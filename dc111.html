                <h2>Basic Information</h2>
                
                <div class="info-box">
                    <p><strong>Date of Revelation:</strong> August 6, 1836</p>
                    <p><strong>Location:</strong> Salem, Massachusetts</p>
                    <p><strong>Recipients:</strong> Joseph Smith, Sidney Rigdon, Hyrum Smith, and Oliver Cowdery</p>
                    <p><strong>Section Summary:</strong> During a journey to Salem seeking financial relief through rumored buried treasure, the Lord lovingly redirects Joseph and his companions, revealing that the true treasure is the souls of people who will join the Church, while teaching patience and divine timing in temporal concerns.</p>

                <h2>Key Principles</h2>
                
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p><strong>Primary Doctrinal Principle:</strong> The greatest treasures are human souls, not material wealth—the Lord's priorities differ from worldly priorities.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Secondary Principle:</strong> The Lord can transform our "follies" and mistakes into opportunities for His purposes when we remain faithful.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Application Principle:</strong> Divine peace and power signal the Lord's will more reliably than financial success or immediate answers to prayers.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Timeframe & Setting</h2>
                
                <h3>Circumstances Among Recipients</h3>
                <p>Joseph Smith was overwhelmed with approximately $13,000 in debt following the Kirtland Temple's completion. A man named Jonathan Burgess had told Joseph about supposedly buried treasure in a Salem cellar, and Joseph—desperate for financial relief—made the risky decision to pursue this lead. His companions Sidney Rigdon, Hyrum Smith, and Oliver Cowdery joined him on this 1,200-mile round trip journey, all anxious about the Church's mounting debts.</p>
                
                <h3>Circumstances Within the Church</h3>
                <p>August 1836 found the Church in a precarious position. The Kirtland Temple had been dedicated in March with great spiritual manifestations, but at tremendous financial cost. Meanwhile, Missouri Saints were facing expulsion from Jackson County, creating additional pressure. The Kirtland Safety Society (bank) would be organized in January 1837, signaling ongoing financial anxieties.</p>
                
                <h3>Relevant Local Circumstances</h3>
                <p>Salem, Massachusetts, was a prosperous port city with significant merchant wealth, which may have influenced the buried treasure rumors. The city had deep Puritan roots and was famous for the 1692-1693 witch trials. Its residents were generally skeptical of new religious movements. The East India Marine Society Museum showcased global trade wealth, emphasizing temporal treasures.</p>
                
                <h3>Relevant Global Circumstances</h3>
                <p>The 1830s experienced economic volatility with the Panic of 1837 looming. Treasure-seeking was culturally accepted—Nathaniel Hawthorne was writing treasure tales in Salem at this time. The Second Great Awakening's emphasis on personal religious experience created openness to new revelation. Maritime trade made Salem internationally connected and culturally diverse.</p>

                <h2>Purpose of the Revelation</h2>
                
                <h3>Short Term</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Redirect Joseph's focus from financial concerns to missionary work and soul-saving</li>
                    <li>Comfort the brethren regarding Church debts while teaching patience</li>
                    <li>Prevent further treasure-seeking that might damage the Church's reputation</li>
                    <li>Provide specific guidance about staying in Salem to preach the gospel</li>
                    <li>Encourage research into Salem's early inhabitants (genealogy and family history work)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Long Term</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Establish that missionary work and conversion of souls is the Lord's priority</li>
                    <li>Teach that the Lord can redeem our mistakes when we remain faithful</li>
                    <li>Provide a pattern for recognizing divine guidance through peace and power</li>
                    <li>Demonstrate that temporal blessings come as a result of spiritual priorities</li>
                    <li>Connect temple work and genealogy to missionary efforts</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Significance</h2>
                
                <h3>Short Term</h3>
                <p>The revelation immediately reoriented the brethren's thinking from treasure-hunting to soul-saving. Rather than sharply rebuking Joseph, the Lord showed mercy by acknowledging the journey's folly while promising future blessings. The brethren began preaching door-to-door in Salem and visiting the East India Marine Society Museum with renewed purpose.</p>
                
                <h3>Long Term</h3>
                <p>This revelation proved prophetic—Salem became a significant missionary area. In 1841, Elder Erastus Snow reported remarkable success there, with the Salem Gazette noting baptisms and the Salem Register reporting that "Mormonism is advancing with a perfect rush in this city." The revelation's pattern of divine patience with human weakness encourages modern Saints.</p>

                <h2>Cultural Insights</h2>
                
                <h3>Ancient Patterns</h3>
                <p>The Lord's patience with Joseph mirrors His dealings with prophets like Jonah, who also pursued misguided paths before fulfilling divine purposes. The emphasis on genealogy and "ancient inhabitants" connects to Hebrew traditions of record-keeping and honoring ancestors. Jesus' teaching that "where your treasure is, there will your heart be also" (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/mat/6/21/">Matthew 6:21</a>) undergirds this revelation.</p>
                
                <h3>Modern Relevance</h3>
                <p>In today's consumer culture, the revelation challenges materialism and financial anxiety. The principle of recognizing God's will through "peace and power" rather than prosperity resonates in an age of prosperity gospel teachings. The Lord's promise to "order all things for your good" (verse 11) provides comfort during economic uncertainties.</p>

                <h2>The Journey to Salem: A Desperate Mission</h2>
                
                <h3>Financial Crisis in Kirtland</h3>
                <p>By summer 1836, Joseph Smith faced crushing debt. The Kirtland Temple, dedicated in March with glorious spiritual manifestations, had cost approximately $40,000—a staggering sum for the small Church. Joseph personally owed around $13,000, with additional obligations looming. Members had sacrificed extraordinarily: women donated china for temple plaster, men worked while fasting, some mortgaged their farms.</p>
                
                <h3>The Treasure Story</h3>
                <p>Into this desperate situation came Jonathan Burgess with an enticing story: a large sum of money supposedly lay buried in the cellar of a house in Salem, Massachusetts. Burgess claimed knowledge of this treasure's location. Given Joseph's treasure-seeking background in his youth (see <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1">Joseph Smith—History 1:55-57</a>) and his desperate financial circumstances, he decided to investigate.</p>
                
                <h3>The 1,200-Mile Journey</h3>
                <p>In late July 1836, the four men left Kirtland for Salem—a journey of approximately 600 miles each way. This represented significant time and expense for men already in debt. The journey demonstrated their desperation and willingness to pursue unlikely solutions to pressing financial problems.</p>

                <h2>Salem: A City of Contrasts</h2>
                
                <h3>Merchant Wealth and Maritime Power</h3>
                <p>Salem was one of America's wealthiest cities in the 1830s. Its merchants had grown rich through global trade, particularly with China and the East Indies. The East India Marine Society Museum showcased exotic treasures from around the world. This visible wealth may have made the buried treasure story seem plausible.</p>
                
                <h3>The Shadow of the Witch Trials</h3>
                <p>Salem remained famous (or infamous) for the 1692-1693 witch trials, during which twenty people were executed for alleged witchcraft. This historical association with religious extremism and false accusations may have made Salem residents particularly skeptical of new religious movements like Mormonism.</p>
                
                <h3>Literary Connections</h3>
                <p>While Joseph and his companions were in Salem, Nathaniel Hawthorne—who lived there—was writing tales of buried treasure. Local newspapers regularly reported treasure-seeking stories. This cultural context normalized treasure-hunting, even as it remained a speculative and often embarrassing pursuit.</p>

                <h2>What Actually Happened in Salem</h2>
                
                <h3>The Failed Quest</h3>
                <p>According to Joseph's August 19, 1836 letter to Emma, they were unable to rent or even access the house where the treasure supposedly lay. The owner refused them entry. The treasure hunt failed completely. This failure could have been devastating—a 1,200-mile journey, significant expense, time away from Church duties, all for nothing.</p>
                
                <h3>The Revelation's Timing</h3>
                <p>On August 6, 1836—relatively early in their Salem stay—Joseph received D&C 111. The Lord did not wait for them to fail completely before redirecting their efforts. This merciful timing prevented further embarrassment and immediately reoriented their purpose. Rather than sharply rebuking them, the Lord acknowledged their "follies" while expressing that He was "not displeased" with their journey (verse 1).</p>
                
                <h3>The Real Treasure: People</h3>
                <p>Following the revelation, the brethren shifted their focus to missionary work. They preached publicly, visited homes, and explored the city. On August 19, they visited the East India Marine Society Museum—not seeking financial treasures, but with new eyes to see Salem's real treasures: its people.</p>

                <h2>Long-Term Fulfillment</h2>
                
                <h3>The 1841 Mission</h3>
                <p>Five years later, in 1841, Elder Erastus Snow was called to serve a mission in Salem. He found remarkable success. The Salem Gazette reported: "A very worthy and respectable laboring man, and his wife, were baptized by immersion in the Mormon Faith." Six months later, the Salem Register noted: "Mormonism is advancing with a perfect rush in this city."</p>
                
                <h3>Many Treasures in Salem</h3>
                <p>The Lord had promised "many people in this city, whom I will gather out in due time for the benefit of Zion" (verse 2) and "there are more treasures than one for you in this city" (verse 10). These prophecies proved true. The converts from Salem brought not only their faith but also their financial means, helping to address the very temporal concerns that had initially driven the journey.</p>
                
                <h3>Genealogical Research</h3>
                <p>The Lord's instruction to "inquire diligently concerning the more ancient inhabitants and founders of this city" (verse 9) proved significant for another reason. Salem housed Essex County records, including genealogies of many early American families—including Joseph Smith's ancestors. Robert Smith, the first of the Smith family in America, had settled in Essex County. This genealogical treasure ultimately served the cause of salvation for the dead.</p>

                        <p><strong>D&C 111:1</strong> — "I, the Lord your God, am not displeased with your coming this journey, notwithstanding your follies."</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <h4>Doctrinal Summary</h4>
                    <p>The Lord begins with remarkable gentleness. Rather than condemning Joseph and his companions for their questionable treasure-seeking journey, He acknowledges their "follies" while expressing that He is "not displeased." This opening establishes a pattern of divine patience with human weakness—the Lord can work with imperfect servants who make mistakes when their hearts remain faithful.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Language & Cultural Insights</h4>
                    <p>The word "<strong>follies</strong>" in 1836 carried less moral condemnation than today. Noah Webster's 1828 dictionary defined folly as "a weak or absurd act; weakness of intellect; imbecility of mind" rather than sin or wickedness. The Lord distinguishes between foolish judgment and wicked rebellion. Joseph's decision to seek treasure was unwise, not immoral.</p>
                    
                    <p>The phrase "<strong>notwithstanding</strong>" signals that the Lord looks beyond human mistakes to see faithful hearts. This echoes the Lord's dealings with other prophets—Abraham's lies about Sarah, Moses' anger at Meribah, Peter's denials—all transformed by divine mercy.</p>

                        <p><strong>D&C 111:2</strong> — "I have much treasure in this city for you, for the benefit of Zion, and many people in this city, whom I will gather out in due time for the benefit of Zion, through your instrumentality."</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <h4>Doctrinal Summary</h4>
                    <p>The Lord dramatically redefines "treasure." Joseph came seeking buried gold; the Lord reveals the true treasure is "many people" who will be gathered to Zion. This establishes a fundamental gospel principle: human souls are infinitely more valuable than material wealth. The phrase "in due time" teaches divine timing—the Lord gathers His people according to His schedule, not ours.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Language & Cultural Insights</h4>
                    <p>The word "<strong>treasure</strong>" (Hebrew: owtsar אוֹצָר; Greek: thēsauros θησαυρός) typically refers to material wealth. The Lord's redefinition is revolutionary—people are treasure. The phrase "<strong>due time</strong>" emphasizes patience and divine timing, echoing the Lord's pattern throughout scripture of working according to His own schedule.</p>
                    
                    <p>"<strong>Through your instrumentality</strong>" indicates that Joseph and his companions would be the means of gathering these souls—their journey would ultimately serve missionary purposes despite its misguided beginning.</p>

                    <h4>Prophetic Fulfillment</h4>
                    <p>In 1841, five years after this revelation, Elder Erastus Snow served a mission in Salem with remarkable success. The Salem Gazette and Salem Register both reported significant baptisms and growth. The "many people" promised were indeed gathered, bringing both spiritual strength and temporal means to bless Zion.</p>

                    <h4>Doctrinal Summary</h4>
                    <p>The Lord provides practical direction: form relationships intentionally. Rather than treasure-hunting, Joseph and his companions should network with people. The phrase "as you shall be led, and as it shall be given you" indicates that the Spirit will guide whom they should meet and teach—this is missionary work directed by revelation, not random socializing.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Language & Cultural Insights</h4>
                    <p>"<strong>Form acquaintance</strong>" means to intentionally build relationships. In the 1830s, this would involve visiting homes, attending public gatherings, engaging in business conversations. The Lord redirects their networking from financial gain to soul-saving purposes.</p>
                    
                    <p>"<strong>As you shall be led</strong>" and "<strong>as it shall be given you</strong>" both indicate divine guidance through the Holy Ghost. This is the pattern for missionary work: follow the Spirit's promptings about whom to teach.</p>

                    <h4>Modern Application</h4>

                    <h4>Doctrinal Summary</h4>
                    <p>The Lord promises eventual temporal blessings, but only after spiritual priorities are established. "In due time" again emphasizes divine timing. The promise that Salem's "wealth pertaining to gold and silver shall be yours" would be fulfilled when converts joined the Church bringing their means—not through finding buried treasure, but through converting souls who would contribute to Zion's building.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Language & Cultural Insights</h4>
                    <p>"<strong>I will give this city into your hands</strong>" means the Lord will give them influence and spiritual power over Salem through successful missionary work. This echoes Joshua's conquest of Canaan—not through military might but through faith.</p>
                    
                    <p>"<strong>They shall not discover your secret parts</strong>" has been interpreted various ways: Some see this as protection of sacred temple ordinances (the Kirtland Temple had just been dedicated with sacred ordinances revealed); others as business affairs remaining private; most likely, it refers to the Church's financial dealings remaining undiscovered by enemies, preventing persecution.</p>
                    
                    <p>"<strong>Wealth pertaining to gold and silver</strong>" acknowledges their temporal needs while subordinating these to spiritual priorities. The Lord will provide—but according to His timing and methods.</p>

                    <h4>Fulfillment</h4>
                    <p>The 1841 Salem converts proved this promise true. Described as "worthy and respectable" citizens, they brought both faith and financial means that helped the Church. The temporal blessings followed spiritual priorities exactly as the Lord promised.</p>

                    <h4>Doctrinal Summary</h4>
                    <p>The Lord directly addresses Joseph's primary anxiety: crushing debt. His command is remarkably simple: stop worrying. Rather than providing immediate financial relief, He promises "power to pay them"—capability rather than instant money. This teaches that anxiety doesn't solve problems; faith and continued service do.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Language & Cultural Insights</h4>
                    <p>"<strong>Concern not yourselves</strong>" echoes Jesus' Sermon on the Mount command to "take no thought for the morrow" (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/mat/6/34/">Matthew 6:34</a>). The Lord doesn't say the concerns are illegitimate—debts must be paid—but that anxiety about them is counterproductive to faith.</p>
                    
                    <p>"<strong>Power to pay them</strong>" doesn't promise immediate money but divine enablement. Whether through converts bringing means, economic opportunities, or Church growth enabling debt service, the emphasis is on the Lord providing capability rather than dramatic bailouts.</p>

                    <p>Joseph's $13,000 debt was eventually paid, though not through treasure-hunting. Church growth brought increased tithing; the Kirtland Safety Society (despite its 1837 failure) temporarily helped; and the move to Missouri/Illinois in 1838-1839 created fresh financial starts. The Lord provided power to pay over time.</p>

                    <h4>Doctrinal Summary</h4>
                    <p>The Lord addresses the second major anxiety: Zion's troubles. Missouri Saints were being expelled from Jackson County, creating pressure on Church leadership. The Lord's counsel mirrors verse 5: stop worrying. He promises mercy for Zion—not immediate deliverance, but divine care and eventual redemption. This teaches that the Lord's work will succeed despite temporary setbacks.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Language & Cultural Insights</h4>
                    <p>"<strong>Zion</strong>" in 1836 referred primarily to Jackson County, Missouri, where Saints had been expelled in 1833. Joseph felt responsible for Zion's redemption but was powerless to achieve it militarily or financially. The Lord's promise that He will "deal mercifully with her" assures that despite appearances, Zion remains under divine protection.</p>
                    
                    <p>"<strong>Deal mercifully</strong>" doesn't promise immediate restoration but divine compassion and eventual fulfillment of promises. The Lord's mercy manifest in His own timing—ultimately through westward migration to the Salt Lake Valley where Zion would be established permanently.</p>

                    <p>The Lord provides direct, practical instruction: remain in Salem and surrounding areas. This redirects their mission from quick treasure-hunting to patient missionary work.

                    <p>"<strong>Tarry</strong>" means to remain, stay, or wait. In biblical usage, it often implies waiting for divine instruction or timing.

                    <p>"<strong>In the regions round about</strong>" expands their area of labor beyond Salem itself to surrounding Massachusetts communities. This suggests systematic missionary work rather than focused treasure-hunting in one location.</p>

                    <p>This verse provides one of scripture's clearest patterns for personal revelation. Divine guidance comes through "peace and power" of the Spirit—not through dramatic signs or financial success. This teaches Saints how to recognize God's will in any situation. Peace provides reassurance; power provides strength to act. Together, they create a complete witness of divine approval.</p>

                    <p>"<strong>Signalized</strong>" means indicated or made known through a signal. The signal is specifically "peace and power"—spiritual feelings rather than external circumstances.</p>
                    
                    <p>"<strong>Peace</strong>" (Hebrew: shalom שָׁלוֹם; Greek: eirēnē εἰρήνη) in scripture means wholeness, completeness, and right relationship with God—not merely absence of conflict. It's deep assurance that one is in God's will.</p>
                    
                    <p>"<strong>Power</strong>" (Hebrew: koach כֹּחַ; Greek: dynamis δύναμις) refers to spiritual strength and capability. When combined with peace, it provides both confirmation and enablement to act.</p>
                    
                    <p>"<strong>Flow unto you</strong>" suggests continuous guidance rather than a single moment—the Spirit's confirmation comes as sustained spiritual feeling.</p>

                        From <strong><a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g878/kjv/tr/0-1/" target="_blank">aphrōn</a></strong> (ἄφρων), "without reason, senseless"<br>
                        Not necessarily sinful but indicating poor judgment</p>
                        
                        <h4>Etymology</h4>
                        <p>From Old French <em>folie</em> "madness, stupidity," from <em>fol</em> "foolish." Ultimately from Latin <em>follis</em> "bellows, bag"—suggesting an empty-headed person, one full of air rather than wisdom.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Doctrinal Significance</h4>
                        <p>The Lord's use of "folly" rather than "sin" or "transgression" signals that Joseph's treasure-seeking journey was unwise but not wicked. This distinction matters: the Lord corrects poor judgment without condemning character. He can work with foolish decisions when hearts remain faithful. This teaches that not every mistake is a sin requiring repentance—some errors simply need wisdom applied going forward.</p>

                        <p>The Lord's revolutionary redefinition of treasure in D&C 111 lies at the heart of Restoration theology: human souls are treasures infinitely more valuable than material wealth. This principle appears throughout scripture but receives explicit articulation here. When Joseph sought buried gold, the Lord revealed "many people" as the true treasure (verse 2) and "more treasures than one" (verse 10). This teaching:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Establishes soul-saving as the primary work of the kingdom</li>
                            <li>Reorients priorities from temporal to eternal concerns</li>
                            <li>Explains why missionary work receives such emphasis</li>
                            <li>Connects treasure-seeking impulse to its proper object: souls</li>
                            <li>Promises that temporal blessings follow spiritual priorities</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Etymology</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Peace:</strong> From Latin <em>pax</em> "peace, treaty," from Proto-Indo-European root <em>*pag-</em> "to fasten"—suggesting binding together in harmony</li>
                            <li><strong>Power:</strong> From Old French <em>poeir</em>, from Latin <em>potere</em> "to be able"—capability and authority combined</li>

                        <h4>Doctrinal Significance</h4>
                        <p>The combination of "peace and power" provides a dual-witness pattern for recognizing divine will:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Peace</strong> gives confirmation—the assurance that a decision is right</li>
                            <li><strong>Power</strong> gives capability—the strength to act on that decision</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>This pattern appears throughout scripture and modern revelation. When both are present, individuals can proceed with confidence. When either is absent—if one feels power without peace (potentially prideful self-will) or peace without power (perhaps comfortable complacency)—further spiritual inquiry is needed. The combination creates balanced revelation.</p>
                        
                        <p>The Lord specifically says these will "flow unto you" (verse 8)—suggesting a continuous stream rather than a single moment. Divine guidance isn't always dramatic but often comes as sustained, subtle spiritual feeling.</p>

                        <p>The command to be "wise as serpents and yet without sin" creates intentional tension: use discernment and shrewdness in navigating the world, but maintain moral purity. This isn't permission for deception but a call to:</p>

                            <li><strong>Observe carefully:</strong> Pay attention to people's motives and situations</li>
                            <li><strong>Think strategically:</strong> Plan wisely rather than acting impulsively</li>
                            <li><strong>Protect what's sacred:</strong> Don't cast pearls before swine (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/mat/7/6/" target="_blank">Matthew 7:6</a>)</li>

                        <p>In D&C 111's context, this counsel tells Joseph and companions: learn from your treasure-seeking mistake (be wise), but don't sin or deceive in pursuit of financial relief. Use good judgment in future financial decisions while maintaining moral standards.</p>

                <h4>Opening Discussion Question</h4>
                <p>"When has a plan that didn't work out turned into a blessing you didn't expect? How did you recognize the Lord's hand in redirecting your path?"</p>
                
                <h4>Key Teaching Points</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>The Lord's Definition of Treasure:</strong> Create a visual comparison chart showing "Worldly Treasures" vs "Eternal Treasures." Have class members contribute examples. Discuss why human souls are the greatest treasure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Recognizing Divine Guidance:</strong> Teach the "Peace and Power" pattern from verse 8. Share examples of how this has worked in your life.</li>
                    <li><strong>Turning Folly into Faith:</strong> Discuss how the Lord transforms our mistakes into learning opportunities. Emphasize that not every mistake is a sin—some are simply unwise choices that God can redeem.</li>
                    <li><strong>Divine Timing:</strong> Explore "due time" (verses 2, 4) and "as fast as ye are able to receive them" (verse 11).</li>

                <h4>Connection to Youth Experience</h4>
                <p>Youth face constant pressure about career choices, college selection, relationships, and financial success. D&C 111 provides a pattern for making decisions when anxious about the future:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The Lord cares more about who you're becoming than what you're accumulating</li>
                    <li>Feeling peace and power is more reliable than calculating financial outcomes</li>
                    <li>Mistakes don't disqualify you from God's love or service</li>
                    <li>God can turn your "follies" into blessings when you remain faithful</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h3>For Family Home Evening</h3>
                <h4>Simplified Lesson for Families with Young Children</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Tell the Story:</strong> "Joseph Smith needed money, so he went to Salem looking for treasure—like buried gold! But Heavenly Father said, 'Joseph, the real treasure isn't gold—it's people! I want you to teach people about Jesus.' And Joseph learned that people are more important than money."</li>
                    <li><strong>Activity:</strong> Have children draw pictures of people who are "treasures" to them—family, friends, teachers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Discussion:</strong> "Why are people more important than toys or money?"</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h3>For Adult Scripture Study</h3>
                <h4>Deep Dive Questions</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>How does D&C 111 help us understand the relationship between temporal and spiritual blessings?</li>
                    <li>The Lord says He's "not displeased" with their journey despite their follies. What does this teach about how God views our mistakes versus our motives?</li>
                    <li>Verse 4 promises "wealth pertaining to gold and silver" but only after fulfilling spiritual priorities. How did this prove true?</li>
                    <li>How does the principle of "peace and power" guide personal revelation?</li>
                    <li>The instruction to research "ancient inhabitants" connects missionary work to genealogy. How are these two forms of treasure-seeking related?</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h3>For Missionary Lessons</h3>
                <h4>How This Revelation Supports Missionary Purposes</h4>
                <p>D&C 111 powerfully teaches that missionary work is the Lord's supreme priority. When Joseph sought treasure, the Lord redirected him to "many people" as the true treasure.</p>
