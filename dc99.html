                    <h4>Basic Information</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Date of Revelation:</strong> August 29, 1832</li>
                        <li><strong>Location:</strong> Hiram, Ohio</li>
                        <li><strong>Recipient:</strong> John Murdock, received through Joseph Smith the Prophet</li>
                        <li><strong>Section Summary:</strong> The Lord calls John Murdock to proclaim the gospel in the eastern countries, promises blessings to those who receive missionaries as little children, and provides counsel about caring for his motherless children before departing on his mission.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                
                <h4>Key Principles</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Primary Doctrinal Principle:</strong> Those who receive the Lord's servants with childlike humility receive His kingdom and obtain mercy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Secondary Principle:</strong> Missionaries serve as witnesses, symbolically "cleansing their feet" as a means of demonstrating their diligence to the Lord, releasing any negative feelings, and leaving outcomes in the Lord's hands without carrying disappointment or feelings of undue responsibility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Application Principle:</strong> The Lord balances spiritual callings with temporal responsibilities, ensuring families are provided for when breadwinners are called to serve.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Timeframe & Setting (4 Layers)</h4>
                
                <p><strong>Circumstances Among Recipients:</strong> John Murdock had been widowed for over a year since his wife Julia died in childbirth on April 30, 1831. His twin babies had been adopted by Joseph and Emma Smith, though one (Joseph Murdock Smith) had died during the March 1832 Hiram mob attack. John was struggling with grief while trying to care for his remaining children and determine how to balance his missionary desires with parental duties.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Circumstances Within the Church:</strong> The Church was recovering from the violent mob attack in Hiram, Ohio (March 1832) where Joseph Smith was tarred and feathered. Missionary work was expanding rapidly despite persecution. Many elders were being called to preach, leaving families behind. The Bishop's role in caring for missionaries' families was becoming more defined. Questions arose about how to provide for temporal needs while fulfilling spiritual callings.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Relevant Local Circumstances:</strong> The Hiram area remained tense after the mob violence. Local opposition to the Church was strong, with ministers actively preaching against the Saints. Economic conditions were difficult, making it challenging for widowers like Murdock to provide for children while serving missions. The community of Saints was developing systems of mutual support for families of missionaries.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Relevant Global Circumstances:</strong> The Second Great Awakening was at its height, creating both religious interest and sectarian competition. The 1830s saw increased mobility with improved roads and transportation, facilitating missionary travel. Social welfare systems were minimal, making family and church support crucial for orphans and widows. Child mortality rates were high, making Murdock's concern for his children's welfare particularly poignant.</p>

                <h4>Significance (Dual Timeline)</h4>
                
                <p><strong>Short Term:</strong> John Murdock faithfully fulfilled this mission call, traveling extensively through the eastern states. His children were cared for by the Saints in Ohio, with Bishop Whitney overseeing their welfare. The mission strengthened branches in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Long Term:</strong> This revelation established important precedents for missionary service and family support that continue today.

                <h3>The Murdock Family Tragedy</h3>
                
                <p>John Murdock's wife Julia died giving birth to twins on April 30, 1831. On the same day, Emma Smith gave birth to twins who died. In an act of compassion, John allowed Joseph and Emma to adopt his twins. During the Hiram mob attack (March 24, 1832), baby Joseph Murdock Smith died from exposure to the cold. Julia Murdock Smith survived and was raised by the Smiths.</p>
                
                <h4>Eastern Countries Mission</h4>
                <p>The "eastern countries" referred to states east of Ohio, including Pennsylvania, New York, and New England. These areas had established branches needing strengthening. John Murdock had previously served successful missions in these regions and knew the territory well.</p>                
                <h4>Church Context in 1832</h4>
                <p>The Church was experiencing rapid growth but also severe persecution. The mob attack in Hiram, Ohio (March 24, 1832) where Joseph Smith was tarred and feathered had shaken the community. Despite this, missionary work was accelerating. The Lord was calling many to preach, requiring the development of systems to care for missionaries' families.</p>
                
                <h4>Cleansing of Feet</h4>
                <p>This was not the first mention of this ordinance (see D&C 24:15; 60:15; 75:20), but this revelation provides additional context about it being done "in secret places." The practice was taken seriously by early missionaries, in part as a final testimony for those who rejected the gospel, but the fact that they performed it "in secret" indicates that this was not intended to be a public spectacle, shaming or casting judgment on others. Rather, it was intended as a personal interaction between the missionary and the Lord, allowing the missionary to demonstrate that he had done all he could, and that he was free from further obligations of responsibility to that community or person. This allowed the missionary to relinquish burdens of remorse, disappointment, guilt, etc., removing those spiritual pollutants and allowing them to move on without regret, preventing them from carrying those feelings into the next assignment.</p>

                    <h4>Summary and Integration</h4>
                    <p>Doctrine and Covenants 99 provides intimate insight into the Lord's individual care for His servants. Key principles include:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Representative Authority:</strong> Missionaries represent Christ directly</li>
                        <li><strong>Childlike Reception:</strong> Humility opens hearts to kingdom blessings</li>
                        <li><strong>Divine Justice:</strong> Rejection of servants brings divine consequences</li>
                        <li><strong>Family Priority:</strong> Temporal needs must be met before spiritual service</li>
                        <li><strong>Individual Callings:</strong> The Lord personalizes calls to individual circumstances</li>
                        <li><strong>Sacrifice and Blessing:</strong> Great sacrifice brings great blessings</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <p>This section demonstrates that the Lord knows each servant personally, understands family circumstances, and provides ways to balance competing responsibilities. John Murdock's example of sacrifice—giving up his children to serve—stands as a powerful witness of consecration.</p>
                    
                    <p>The revelation's promise that those who receive missionaries "as a little child" receive the kingdom reminds us that humility and teachability are essential for spiritual growth. The unique choice offered to John shows the Lord's flexibility within His perfect plan.</p>
                    
                    <p>For modern readers, this revelation affirms that God knows our individual circumstances and will provide ways to serve Him while caring for family responsibilities. The Church's welfare system continues this pattern of supporting those who sacrifice for the kingdom.</p>

                <h3>Practical Applications for Modern Saints</h3>                
                <h4>Personal Ministry</h4>
                <p>John Murdock's call to go "from house to house, from village to village, and from city to city" teaches us about personal ministry. In our digital age, this pattern reminds us that genuine gospel sharing happens through personal relationships and individual connections, not just mass communication.</p>
                
                <h4>Balancing Family and Church Service</h4>
                <p>The Lord's instruction that John should not depart until his children were "provided for, and sent up kindly unto the bishop" establishes an eternal principle: family responsibilities must be balanced with Church service. The Lord never asks us to neglect family duties for His work.</p>
                
                <h4>Receiving Truth with Childlike Humility</h4>
                <p>The promise that those who receive missionaries "as a little child" receive the kingdom challenges our sophisticated age. Childlike qualities include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Teachability without skepticism</li>
                    <li>Trust without demanding proof</li>
                    <li>Humility without pride</li>
                    <li>Openness without prejudice</li>
                    <li>Joy without reservation</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Handling Rejection</h4>
                <p>The instruction to cleanse feet "in secret places" teaches important principles about handling rejection:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Don't make public spectacles of those who reject truth</li>
                    <li>Leave judgment to God</li>
                    <li>Move forward without bitterness</li>
                    <li>Continue serving despite opposition</li>
                    <li>Trust in divine justice</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>For Teachers and Leaders</h4>
                    <p>When teaching from D&C 99, consider these approaches:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Share John Murdock's story</strong> - His sacrifice makes the principles real and relatable</li>
                        <li><strong>Discuss modern applications</strong> - How do we balance family and Church today?</li>
                        <li><strong>Explore childlike qualities</strong> - What prevents us from receiving truth?</li>
                        <li><strong>Address missionary work</strong> - How can we share the gospel personally?</li>
                        <li><strong>Examine individual callings</strong> - How does the Lord personalize our service?</li>
                    </ul>
