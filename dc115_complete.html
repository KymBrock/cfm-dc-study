                <div class="info-box">
                    <p><strong>Date of Revelation:</strong> April 26, 1838</p>
                    <p><strong>Location:</strong> <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/history/topics/far-west-missouri?lang=eng">Far West</a>, Missouri</p>
                    <p><strong>Recipient:</strong> <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/history/topics/joseph-smith?lang=eng">Joseph Smith</a> and the Church</p>
                    <p><strong>Context:</strong> Construction of the Far West temple and church organization</p>
                </div>

                <p><strong>Section Summary:</strong> In this revelation, the <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2962/kjv/tr/0-1/">Lord</a> formally declares the official name of the Church—"The Church of <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2424/kjv/tr/0-1/">Jesus</a> <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5547/kjv/tr/0-1/">Christ</a> of Latter-day Saints"—establishing divine ownership and identity. The Lord commands the Saints to build a temple in Far West with specific construction timelines and protocols, calls them to faithfulness despite persecution, and promises that those who remain steadfast will see the downfall of their enemies.</p>

                <h2>Key Principles</h2>

                <p><strong>Primary Doctrinal Principle:</strong> The Church belongs to <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2424/kjv/tr/0-1/">Jesus</a> <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5547/kjv/tr/0-1/">Christ</a>, bears His name by divine command, and exists as His latter-day organization to prepare for His Second Coming.</p>

                <p><strong>Secondary Principle:</strong> Building temples demonstrates faith in <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2316/kjv/tr/0-1/">God's</a> promises and commitment to covenant worship, even when external circumstances appear hostile to such sacred work.</p>

                <p><strong>Application Principle:</strong> Taking Christ's name upon us through baptism and covenant worship requires us to stand with courage, build His kingdom through action, and trust His promises despite opposition.</p>

                <h2>Timeframe & Setting</h2>

                <h3>Circumstances Among Recipients</h3>

                <p>By April 1838, Far West had become the new Church headquarters after the Saints' expulsion from Kirtland, Ohio. Thousands of faithful members had relocated to Caldwell County, Missouri, creating a thriving community of approximately 5,000 Saints. They had established homes, businesses, and civic order, with Joseph Smith arriving in March 1838 to lead the growing settlement.</p>

                <p>The Saints had fled Kirtland after intense apostasy, financial collapse of the <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/history/topics/kirtland-safety-society?lang=eng">Kirtland Safety Society</a>, and violent persecution. Many arrived in Missouri impoverished, having abandoned property and possessions. Despite hardships, they exhibited remarkable faith and industry.</p>

                <h3>Circumstances Within the Church</h3>

                <p>The Church had experimented with different names since its organization in 1830, including "The Church of Christ," "The Church of the Latter Day Saints," and variations combining these elements. This lack of consistent identity created confusion about the Church's true nature and mission. Meanwhile, apostasy in Kirtland had shaken confidence, with prominent leaders leaving and taking followers with them.</p>

                <p>As members left the Church, some formed splinter groups claiming to be the "true" restoration. The need for an official, divinely revealed name became urgent to distinguish the Lord's Church from imitators and to establish clear identity.</p>

                <h2>Purpose of the Revelation</h2>

                <h3>Short Term</h3>
                <ul>

                    <li>Establish Far West as the new Church headquarters</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Long Term</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Establish the Church's permanent identity centered on <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2424/kjv/tr/0-1/">Jesus</a> <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5547/kjv/tr/0-1/">Christ</a></li>

                    <li>Provide prophetic witness that God's covenant people will prevail over opposition</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Modern Application</h2>

                <h3>Personal Application</h3>
                <p><strong>Name and Identity:</strong> When you take Christ's name through baptism and renew that covenant through the sacrament, recognize you represent Him in all your actions and words.</p>

                <p><strong>Building Faith:</strong> Like the Saints who built temples amid opposition, strengthen your faith by "building"—setting goals, establishing righteous patterns, creating covenant homes.</p>

                <p><strong>Enduring Opposition:</strong> When facing criticism or opposition for Church membership, remember the Lord promises protection and ultimate vindication to the faithful.</p>

                <h3>Key Doctrines</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Church's official name is "The Church of <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2424/kjv/tr/0-1/">Jesus</a> <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5547/kjv/tr/0-1/">Christ</a> of Latter-day Saints" by divine revelation</li>
                    <li>The Church takes Christ's name because it is built upon His gospel and He is its head</li>
                    <li>The designation "Latter-day Saints" distinguishes this dispensation from former-day saints</li>
                    <li>The Lord requires specific obedience in temple building, including timeline and ceremonial procedures</li>
                    <li>Those who remain faithful amid persecution will witness their enemies' downfall while remaining safe</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="panel-content">
                
                <h2>Historical Background</h2>
                
                <p><strong>Date:</strong> April 26, 1838<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/history/topics/far-west-missouri?lang=eng">Far West</a>, Caldwell County, Missouri</p>

                <p>Far West had recently become Church headquarters following the Saints' exodus from Kirtland, Ohio in early 1838. The city was laid out with typical Mormon efficiency—wide streets, central public square for the temple, and residential plots surrounding the center. By April 1838, approximately 4,000-5,000 Saints had gathered there, building homes and attempting to establish a secure refuge from persecution.</p>

                <h2>The Crisis of Apostasy (1837-1838)</h2>

                <h3>The Kirtland Safety Society Failure</h3>

                <p>January 1837 saw the <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/history/topics/kirtland-safety-society?lang=eng">collapse of the Kirtland Safety Society</a>, a financial institution founded by Church leaders to provide economic stability for the Saints. When the institution failed during the nationwide Panic of 1837, many Church members lost significant investments.</p>

                <p>The financial disaster triggered a faith crisis. Some prominent members blamed <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/history/topics/joseph-smith?lang=eng">Joseph Smith</a> for their losses, questioning his prophetic judgment and even his calling as prophet. Internal dissension exploded into open apostasy. The winter of 1837-1838 saw some of the Church's darkest days as respected leaders turned against Joseph Smith and the restored gospel.</p>

                <h3>Prominent Apostates</h3>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <p><strong>Among those who fell away</strong> during this period were members of high standing:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Luke and Lyman Johnson</strong> (apostles) were excommunicated in 1838 for apostasy</li>
                        <li><strong>John F. Boynton</strong> (apostle) left the Church in 1837</li>
                        <li><strong>William E. McLellin</strong> (apostle) apostatized and became a bitter enemy</li>
                        <li><strong>Thomas B. Marsh</strong> (president of the Twelve) would apostatize in October 1838</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h2>The Need for Official Church Name</h2>

                <p>Since the Church's organization in 1830, various names had been used informally: "The Church of Christ," "The Church of the Latter Day Saints," and combinations thereof. This created confusion and allowed splinter groups to claim legitimacy. The revelation provided divine authority for the official name, resolving identity questions and distinguishing the Lord's Church from imitators.</p>

                <h2>The Far West Temple Command</h2>

                <p>Commanding temple construction when the Saints were impoverished refugees facing mounting opposition demonstrated faith over circumstances. The pattern had ancient precedent: Israel received tabernacle instructions while wandering in the wilderness, and returned exiles rebuilt Jerusalem's temple amid fierce opposition.</p>

                <p>Tragically, the Far West temple was never completed. Cornerstones were laid July 4, 1838, but construction never progressed beyond excavation before the Saints were expelled from Missouri during the 1838 Mormon War. However, <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124.49?lang=eng">D&C 124:49-51</a> later clarified that when enemies prevent temple completion, the Lord accepts the Saints' offerings.</p>

                <p>D&C 115 addresses two fundamental questions that troubled the Far West Saints in April 1838: What is the Church's official name? Should they build another temple after losing Kirtland? The revelation provides direct, authoritative answers that established the Church's permanent identity and commanded sacred work despite external opposition.</p>

                        <h3>Doctrinal Summary</h3>
                        
                        <p>The <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2962/kjv/tr/0-1/">Lord</a> begins with personal address, naming specific leaders and then expanding to all Church members "scattered abroad in all the world." This pattern demonstrates divine awareness of individuals while addressing universal principles. Verse 3 contains the crucial declaration of the Church's official name: "The Church of <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2424/kjv/tr/0-1/">Jesus</a> <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5547/kjv/tr/0-1/">Christ</a> of Latter-day Saints."</p>

                        <h3>Language & Cultural Insights</h3>
                        
                        <p><strong>"My servant"</strong> - Hebrew <strong><a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h5650/kjv/wlc/0-1/">ebed</a></strong> (עֶבֶד) means "servant, slave, worshiper." It implies covenant relationship, not mere employment. Moses, Joshua, David, and the prophets were all called God's servants.</p>

                        <p><strong>"Zion"</strong> - Hebrew <strong><a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h6726/kjv/wlc/0-1/">Tsiyown</a></strong> (צִיּוֹן), originally the name of the Jebusite fortress David conquered, became synonymous with Jerusalem, God's holy city. In Latter-day Saint theology, Zion represents both a physical location and a spiritual condition ("the pure in heart," <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/97.21?lang=eng">D&C 97:21</a>).</p>

                        <p><strong>"Saints"</strong> - Greek <strong><a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g40/kjv/tr/0-1/">hagios</a></strong> (ἅγιος) means "holy ones, set apart." The designation "Latter-day Saints" claims continuity with ancient Christians while acknowledging a distinct dispensation.</p>

                        <p>This verse provides the theological rationale for the Church's name. Three critical elements emerge:</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>1. "My church"</strong> - Possessive language establishes ownership. This is not Joseph Smith's church, but Christ's Church.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>2. "In the last days"</strong> - Temporal designation distinguishing this dispensation from previous ones.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>3.

                        <p>These verses transition from identity (name) to mission (purpose). The Lord commands "Arise and shine forth"—active verbs requiring response. The Saints aren't merely to exist but to actively radiate light that becomes "a standard for the nations."</p>

                        <p><strong>"Standard"</strong> carries military and spiritual connotations. Anciently, military standards (banners, flags) marked rallying points for armies. The Church and its members become reference points by which others can orient themselves toward truth.</p>

                        <p>These verses contain the temple-building command. Verse 7 declares Far West "holy and consecrated land," echoing the Lord's words to Moses: "The place whereon thou standest is holy ground" (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/exo/3/5/">Exodus 3:5</a>).</p>

                        <p>Verse 8's command is direct: "build a house unto me." This marks the second temple commanded in the Restoration. The pattern emerges: wherever Saints gather, they build temples. Temple-building defines covenant people.</p>

                        <h3>Doctrinal Summary</h3>
                        
                        <p>These verses establish critical conditions and promises regarding temple worship. The Lord promises two profound blessings if Saints build the temple properly and keep it holy:</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>1. Divine Glory:</strong> "My glory shall rest upon it" (verse 11). This echoes the Shekinah glory that filled Solomon's temple (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/1ki/8/10/">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>) and Moses' tabernacle (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/exo/40/34/">Exodus 40:34-35</a>).</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>2. Divine Presence:</strong> "My presence shall be there, for I will come into it" (verse 12). The Lord promises personal visitation to properly consecrated temples.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>3. Theophany:</strong> "All the pure in heart that shall come into it shall see <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h430/kjv/wlc/0-1/">God</a>" (verse 12). This remarkable promise indicates that the pure in heart can experience divine manifestations in temples.</p>
                        
                        <p>However, verse 13 provides equally strong warning: if the temple is defiled, <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h430/kjv/wlc/0-1/">God</a> will not enter it, His glory will depart, and He "will not come into unholy temples." Temple sanctity requires constant vigilance.</p>
                        
                        <p>Verse 14's promise that Zion will "prosper, and spread herself and become very glorious, very great, and very terrible" depends on faithful temple worship. The repetition of "very" three times emphasizes the magnitude of promised blessings.</p>

                        <p><strong>"Suffer any unclean thing"</strong> - Hebrew <strong><a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h2930/kjv/wlc/0-1/">tame</a></strong> (טָמֵא) means "unclean, defiled." In Israelite law, ritual impurity prevented temple entry. Here it extends beyond ritual to moral and spiritual purity.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>"Glory"</strong> - Hebrew <strong><a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h3519/kjv/wlc/0-1/">kavod</a></strong> (כָּבוֹד) literally means "weight, heaviness," metaphorically representing <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h430/kjv/wlc/0-1/">God's</a> weighty presence and manifest splendor. Greek <strong><a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1391/kjv/tr/0-1/">doxa</a></strong> (δόξα) means "glory, splendor, brightness."</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>"Pure in heart"</strong> - Hebrew <strong><a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h1249/kjv/wlc/0-1/">bar</a></strong> (בַּר) means "pure, clean" and <strong><a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h3824/kjv/wlc/0-1/">levav</a></strong> (לֵבָב) means "heart, inner man." Greek <strong><a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2513/kjv/tr/0-1/">katharos</a></strong> (καθαρός) means "clean, pure" combined with <strong><a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2588/kjv/tr/0-1/">kardia</a></strong> (καρδία) "heart." Purity of heart implies moral integrity, sincere devotion, and freedom from duplicity.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>"Terrible"</strong> - Hebrew <strong><a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h3372/kjv/wlc/0-1/">yare</a></strong> (יָרֵא) means "fearful, awesome, to be feared." This isn't "terrible" in the negative sense but "awe-inspiring, commanding reverence." Zion will inspire reverent fear in her enemies.</p>

                        <h3>Doctrinal Summary</h3>
                        
                        <p>These verses explain the profound purpose behind temple-building: revelation of ordinances. The <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h3068/kjv/wlc/0-1/">Lord</a> promises to "reveal mine ordinances therein unto my people" (verse 15) and to "reveal unto my church things which have been kept hid from before the foundation of the world" (verse 16).</p>
                        
                        <p>The temple isn't merely a building for meetings but a revelation space. Once constructed, the <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h3068/kjv/wlc/0-1/">Lord</a> will progressively reveal ordinances within its sacred walls. This promise was fulfilled in Nauvoo, where Joseph Smith received and administered the endowment, eternal marriage sealings, and other ordinances not yet revealed in 1838.</p>
                        
                        <p>Verse 16's phrase "kept hid from before the foundation of the world" parallels <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/eph/3/9/">Ephesians 3:9</a>, "the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2316/kjv/tr/0-1/">God</a>," and <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/mat/13/35/">Matthew 13:35</a>, "I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world." These aren't new inventions but restoration of ancient truths preserved through all dispensations.</p>
                        
                        <p>The phrase "dispensation of the fulness of times" (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/eph/1/10/">Ephesians 1:10</a>) indicates that this final dispensation receives all previous dispensations' keys, knowledge, and authority.</p>

                        <p><strong>"Deign"</strong> - Means "to condescend, to stoop to give." The <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h3068/kjv/wlc/0-1/">Lord</a>, in His majesty, condescends to reveal sacred things to mortals. This word emphasizes the gift nature of revelation—we don't earn or demand it; <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2316/kjv/tr/0-1/">God</a> graciously grants it.</p>

The passive voice indicates these truths were deliberately concealed by <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2316/kjv/tr/0-1/">God</a> until the proper time for revelation. <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/dan/12/4/">Daniel 12:4</a> prophesied: "Seal the book, even to the time of the end."</p>

This phrase from <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/eph/1/10/">Ephesians 1:10</a> describes <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2316/kjv/tr/0-1/">God's</a> plan to "gather together in one all things in <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5547/kjv/tr/0-1/">Christ</a>." The final dispensation gathers all previous revelations, keys, and authorities.</p>

                        <h3>Doctrinal Summary</h3>
                        
                        <p>Verse 17 provides one of the most comforting doctrines in scripture: the deceased can call upon the <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h3068/kjv/wlc/0-1/">Lord's</a> name "in the hour of their final tribulation" and receive forgiveness of sins through proxy ordinances performed in temples. This verse establishes several critical principles:</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>1. Agency in the Spirit World:</strong> The dead maintain moral agency. They can "call upon my name in their behalf"—actively seeking salvation rather than passively receiving it.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>2. Repentance Beyond Death:</strong> The phrase "receive forgiveness of their sins" indicates that repentance occurs in the spirit world. <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/1pe/3/18/">1 Peter 3:18-20</a> confirms <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5547/kjv/tr/0-1/">Christ</a> preached to spirits in prison, offering them opportunity to repent.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>3. Final Tribulation:</strong> The "hour of their final tribulation" may refer to the spirit world period before final judgment—a time of anguish as they recognize their sins and long for forgiveness but lack bodies to perform ordinances.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>4. Proximity to Celestial Glory:</strong> The phrase "even unto those who stand in the very door of the celestial kingdom" suggests the dead can progress to the threshold of exaltation but require earthly proxy work to enter.</p>
                        
                        <p>Verse 18 provides specific dimensions: "fifty-five by sixty-five feet in the inner court." This practical detail demonstrates the <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h3068/kjv/wlc/0-1/">Lord's</a> involvement in even mundane architectural specifics.</p>
                        
                        <p>Verse 19's instruction for "a deacon... to keep the place, that there may be no disturbance" emphasizes temple sanctity. Sacred space requires protection from disruption.</p>

                        <h3>Language & Cultural Insights</h3>
                        
                        <p><strong>"Call upon my name"</strong> - Hebrew <strong><a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7121/kjv/wlc/0-1/">qara</a></strong> (קָרָא) + <strong><a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h8034/kjv/wlc/0-1/">shem</a></strong> (שֵׁם) means "to call on the name," a phrase used throughout scripture for invoking <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2316/kjv/tr/0-1/">God</a> in worship, prayer, or seeking salvation (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/gen/4/26/">Genesis 4:26</a>, <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/psa/116/4/">Psalm 116:4</a>, <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/rom/10/13/">Romans 10:13</a>). The dead retain this privilege and capacity.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>"Hour of their final tribulation"</strong> - Greek <strong><a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2347/kjv/tr/0-1/">thlipsis</a></strong> (θλῖψις) means "pressure, affliction, tribulation, distress." The spirit world period between death and resurrection brings tribulation as spirits recognize their need for ordinances they can't personally perform.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>"Stand in the very door"</strong> - Vivid imagery of being at the threshold but unable to enter without help. Ancient Near Eastern doors had symbolic significance—thresholds marked boundaries between sacred and common space. The deceased may be worthy but lack the "key" (ordinances) to open the door.</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Agency of the Dead:</strong> How does understanding that the deceased can "call upon <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5547/kjv/tr/0-1/">Christ's</a> name" and repent in the spirit world affect your view of ancestors who died without the gospel? Does this doctrine give you hope for specific relatives?</li>
                            <li><strong>At the Door:</strong> Imagine standing at the celestial kingdom's door, able to see inside, knowing you belong there, but unable to enter because no one on earth has performed your ordinances. How does this image motivate your temple and family history work?</li>
                            <li><strong>Sacred Space Protection:</strong> Verse 19 commands a deacon to prevent "disturbance" in the temple. What "disturbances" (irreverent thoughts, worldly concerns, rushing) might you need to guard against in your own temple worship to maintain sacred space?</li>

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                
                <p>D&C 115 establishes the Church's official name and commands temple building. While the revelation uses modern English, it extensively references biblical passages. This word study analyzes key terms using the full 5-layer approach: Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Etymology, and Webster 1828.</p>

                <!-- WORD 1: CHURCH -->
                <div class="word-study-box">
                    <h3>TERM 1: "Church"</h3>
                    
                    <h4>Hebrew Analysis</h4>
                    <p><strong><a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h6951/kjv/wlc/0-1/">Qahal</a></strong> (קָהָל) - "assembly, congregation, gathered community." Used throughout Old Testament for Israel's religious assembly. Implies covenant community, not casual gathering.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Greek Analysis</h4>
                    <p><strong><a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1577/kjv/tr/0-1/">Ekklesia</a></strong> (ἐκκλησία) - "called out ones, assembly, church." From ek (out) + kaleo (to call). New Testament: those called out from the world into covenant relationship with Christ. Used 115 times in New Testament.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Latin Analysis</h4>
                    <p><strong><a href="https://logeion.uchicago.edu/ecclesia">Ecclesia</a></strong> - Direct borrowing from Greek ekklesia. In Christian Latin: the Church as institution and spiritual body.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Etymology</h4>
                    <p><strong><a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/church">Church</a></strong> - Old English cirice, from Greek kyriake (oikia), "Lord's (house)." Emphasis on belonging to the Lord, not merely gathering.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Webster 1828</h4>
                    <p><strong><a href="https://webstersdictionary1828.com/Dictionary/church">CHURCH</a></strong> - "A house consecrated to the worship of God... The collective body of Christians... A particular number of Christians, united under one form of ecclesiastical government."</p>
                    
                    <h4>Doctrinal Significance</h4>
                    <p>When the Lord declares "my Church" (verse 4), He claims ownership using possessive language that echoes His covenant with Israel. The etymology reveals that "church" fundamentally means "belonging to the Lord"—it belongs to Him, not to any human founder.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- WORD 2: SAINTS -->
                <div class="word-study-box">
                    <h3>TERM 2: "Saints"</h3>
                    
                    <h4>Hebrew Analysis</h4>
                    <p><strong><a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h6918/kjv/wlc/0-1/">Qadosh</a></strong> (קָדוֹשׁ) - "holy one, saint, sacred." From root qadash (to be set apart, consecrated, holy). Implies separation from common to sacred purposes.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Greek Analysis</h4>
                    <p><strong><a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g40/kjv/tr/0-1/">Hagios</a></strong> (ἅγιος) - "holy, set apart, saints." Most common New Testament term for believers. Not moral perfection but covenantal set-apartness.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Latin Analysis</h4>
                    <p><strong><a href="https://logeion.uchicago.edu/sanctus">Sanctus</a></strong> - "holy, sacred, consecrated." Root: sancio (to make sacred, confirm solemnly). Source of English "saint," "sanctify," "sanctuary."</p>
                    
                    <h4>Etymology</h4>
                    <p><strong><a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/saint">Saint</a></strong> - From Latin sanctus, "holy, consecrated." Restoration usage returns to New Testament broad application to all covenant members.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Doctrinal Significance</h4>
                    <p>D&C 115's designation "Latter-day Saints" reclaims the New Testament practice of calling all covenant members "saints." This isn't a claim to moral perfection but to covenant relationship—being "set apart" for sacred purposes. The term distinguishes this dispensation's saints from "former-day saints" (ancient Christians).</p>

                    <h3>TERM 3: "Zion"</h3>
                    
                    <h4>Hebrew Analysis</h4>
                    <p><strong><a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h6726/kjv/wlc/0-1/">Tsiyown</a></strong> (צִיּוֹן) - Originally the Jebusite fortress David conquered, became synonymous with Jerusalem, God's holy city, the place of His dwelling.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Doctrinal Significance</h4>
                    <p>In verse 3, "Zion" represents both physical location (initially Independence, Missouri) and spiritual condition ("the pure in heart," <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/97.21?lang=eng">D&C 97:21</a>). Temple connection: Zion is where God's people gather to His house for covenant worship.</p>

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                
                <p>D&C 115 addresses two foundational questions: What is the Church's official name? Why build temples amid persecution? These teaching applications provide practical ways to help learners understand and apply D&C 115's profound truths about identity, purpose, and covenant worship.</p>

                <h2>1. Personal Study Applications</h2>
                
                <h3>Name-Centered Study</h3>
                <p>Study the Church's official name systematically over five days:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Day 1:</strong> Study "The Church" - Why "the" (definite article) matters</li>
                    <li><strong>Day 2:</strong> Study "of <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2424/kjv/tr/0-1/">Jesus</a> <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5547/kjv/tr/0-1/">Christ</a>" - Ownership and foundation</li>
                    <li><strong>Day 3:</strong> Study "Latter-day" - This dispensation's unique role</li>
                    <li><strong>Day 4:</strong> Study "Saints" - Covenant people set apart</li>
                    <li><strong>Day 5:</strong> Put it all together - How the name shapes your identity</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Temple Timeline Study</h3>
                <p>Create a personal timeline connecting you to temple blessings:</p>
                <ul>

                <h3>Opening Activity: "What's in a Name?"</h3>
                <p><strong>Setup:</strong> Write the full Church name on a large poster board, breaking it into parts.</p>
                <p><strong>Activity:</strong> Family members take turns explaining what each part means. Discuss: "Why did the Lord reveal the official name? What does each word teach us?"</p>
                <p><strong>Connection:</strong> The name shows we belong to <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2424/kjv/tr/0-1/">Jesus</a> <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5547/kjv/tr/0-1/">Christ</a>, live in the latter days, and are set apart as His people.</p>

                <h3>Object Lesson: Building Blocks</h3>
                <p><strong>Materials:</strong> Building blocks or LEGOs</p>
                <p><strong>Teaching:</strong> Start building a structure, then have someone knock it down partway through. Discuss: "The Saints were building homes in Far West, and the Lord commanded them to build a temple. Then persecutors drove them away. Did God's plan fail?"</p>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> No! Though they couldn't finish the Far West temple, they built others (Nauvoo, Salt Lake, and hundreds worldwide). God's work continues despite opposition.</p>

                <h3>Discussion Starter</h3>
                <p>"Imagine someone asks you, 'Why does your church have such a long name?' How would you explain that each part of the name teaches important doctrine?"</p>

                <h3>Key Teaching Point</h3>
                <p><strong>Core Principle:</strong> The Church belongs to <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2424/kjv/tr/0-1/">Jesus</a> <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5547/kjv/tr/0-1/">Christ</a>, not to any human organization or leader.</p>
                <p><strong>Teaching Method:</strong> Create a visual showing different church names people use: "LDS Church," "Mormon Church," etc. Discuss why the full, revealed name matters.</p>

                <h3>Day 1: Identity in Christ</h3>
                <p><strong>Focus:</strong> Verse 4 - The revealed name</p>
                <p><strong>Youth Application:</strong> How does being a member of "The Church of <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2424/kjv/tr/0-1/">Jesus</a> <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5547/kjv/tr/0-1/">Christ</a>" shape your identity at school, work, and with friends?</p>
                <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> This week, use the full Church name when introducing yourself to others.</p>

                <h3>Day 2: Temple Building Shows Faith</h3>
                <p><strong>Focus:</strong> Verses 7-8 - Temple command</p>
                <p><strong>Teaching:</strong> The Saints were refugees with little money, yet God commanded them to build a temple. What does this teach about spiritual priorities versus material comfort?</p>
                <p><strong>Application:</strong> What "temples" (sacred goals, spiritual patterns) should you build in your life despite challenges?</p>

                <h3>Discussion Topic: Standing as a Witness</h3>
                <p><strong>Opening Question:</strong> "How do you respond when someone uses nicknames for the Church instead of the full, revealed name?"</p>
                <p><strong>Teaching:</strong> Verse 5 commands us to "arise and shine forth." Using the Lord's revealed name is one way we shine forth as His covenant people.</p>
                <p><strong>Practical Application:</strong> Practice polite ways to correct misunderstandings: "We're actually called The Church of <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2424/kjv/tr/0-1/">Jesus</a> <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5547/kjv/tr/0-1/">Christ</a> of Latter-day Saints because Christ is the head of the Church."</p>

                <h3>Teaching Principle: Christ's Church, Not Man's</h3>
                <p><strong>For Investigators:</strong> Help them understand the significance of the revealed name. This isn't Joseph Smith's church or any other human's organization—it belongs to <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2424/kjv/tr/0-1/">Jesus</a> <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5547/kjv/tr/0-1/">Christ</a>.</p>
                <p><strong>Scripture:</strong> Read verse 4 together. Ask: "Why do you think the Lord cares so much about what His Church is called?"</p>
