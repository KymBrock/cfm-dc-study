                <h2>Section Overview</h2>
                
                <h3>Basic Information</h3>
                <p><strong>Date of Revelation:</strong> June 22, 1834</p>
                <p><strong>Location:</strong> Fishing River, Missouri</p>
                <p><strong>Recipients:</strong> Joseph Smith and Zion's Camp</p>
                <p><strong>Verses:</strong> 41 verses</p>
                <p><strong>Section Summary:</strong> The Lord postpones the redemption of Zion, explaining that the Saints must first receive an endowment of power from on high and learn obedience through tribulation before Zion can be established.</p>
                
                <h3>Key Principles</h3>
                <p><strong>Primary Doctrinal Principle:</strong> Preparation through tribulation precedes deliverance</p>
                <p><strong>Secondary Principle:</strong> Endowment of power necessary for Zion's redemption</p>
                <p><strong>Application Principle:</strong> Sacrifice and obedience qualify us for divine blessings</p>                
                <h3>Timeframe & Setting</h3>
                
                <h4>Circumstances Among Recipients</h4>
                <p>Zion's Camp had marched nearly 900 miles from Ohio to Missouri, expecting to restore the Saints to their lands in Jackson County. Members were exhausted, some were discouraged by the lack of military action, and questions arose about the purpose of their sacrifice.</p>
                
                <h4>Circumstances Within the Church</h4>
                <p>The Saints had been violently expelled from Jackson County in November 1833. The Missouri government initially promised assistance but withdrew support. The Church faced the challenge of establishing Zion without temporal power or political influence.</p>
                
                <h3>Major Doctrines</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Endowment of Power:</strong> Temple endowment necessary for Zion's redemption</li>
                    <li><strong>Law of Sacrifice:</strong> Obedience learned through tribulation</li>
                    <li><strong>Divine Timing:</strong> "Little season" of preparation before redemption</li>
                    <li><strong>Peace Priority:</strong> Sue for peace rather than seek revenge</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Historical Context</h2>
                
                <h3>The Setting</h3>
                <p>Zion's Camp arrived at Fishing River, Missouri, on June 19, 1834. The camp of approximately 200 men had marched from Kirtland, Ohio, with the expectation of helping restore the Saints to their lands in Jackson County. However, Missouri Governor Daniel Dunklin, who had initially promised government support, withdrew his assistance when local opposition intensified.</p>
                
                <h3>Key Events Leading to This Revelation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>November 1833:</strong> Saints violently expelled from Jackson County</li>
                    <li><strong>February 1834:</strong> D&C 103 commanded organization of Zion's Camp</li>
                    <li><strong>May-June 1834:</strong> 900-mile march from Ohio to Missouri</li>
                    <li><strong>June 19, 1834:</strong> Camp arrives at Fishing River</li>
                    <li><strong>June 19-21, 1834:</strong> Negotiations with Missouri officials fail</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Immediate Circumstances</h3>
                <p>On June 19, a mob of about 400 Missourians gathered to attack Zion's Camp. A miraculous storm scattered the mob, saving the camp from destruction. However, it became clear that military action would not restore the Saints to their lands. The camp members, exhausted and uncertain, needed divine direction about their sacrificial march.</p>
                
                <h3>Key People Involved</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Joseph Smith:</strong> Prophet and leader of Zion's Camp</li>
                    <li><strong>Zion's Camp Members:</strong> Approximately 200 faithful men who marched</li>
                    <li><strong>Governor Daniel Dunklin:</strong> Missouri governor who withdrew support</li>
                    <li><strong>Missouri Mobs:</strong> Local citizens opposing Mormon settlement</li>
                </ul>                
                <h3>Connection to Other Revelations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>D&C 103:</strong> Commanded the organization of Zion's Camp and promised divine assistance</li>
                    <li><strong>D&C 104:</strong> Given during preparation, organized the United Order</li>
                    <li><strong>D&C 38:32:</strong> Earlier promise of endowment of power from on high</li>
                    <li><strong>D&C 97:</strong> Definition of Zion as the pure in heart</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Aftermath and Impact</h3>
                <p>Following this revelation, cholera struck the camp within days, claiming 14 lives. The camp was disbanded on June 24, 1834. Despite apparent failure, Zion's Camp became a crucial training ground—over 80% of early Church leadership came from its participants. The focus shifted from Missouri to completing the Kirtland Temple, where the promised endowment was received in 1836.</p>

                        <p><strong>3</strong> But behold, they have not learned to be obedient to the things which I required at their hands, but are full of all manner of evil, and do not impart of their substance, as becometh saints, to the poor and afflicted among them;</p>                        <p><strong>4</strong> And are not united according to the union required by the law of the celestial kingdom;</p>
