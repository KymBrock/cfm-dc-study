<h2>D&C 122: Section Overview</h2>
<h3>"All These Things Shall Give Thee Experience"</h3>


<h3>Basic Information</h3>
<br>
<strong>Date of Revelation:</strong> March 20, 1839<br>
<strong>Location:</strong> Liberty Jail, Clay County, Missouri<br>
<strong>Recipient:</strong> Joseph Smith (with application to all covenant disciples)<br>
<strong>Context:</strong> Continuation of the Liberty Jail letter recorded in D&C 121; the Lord answers Joseph's anguished questions by cataloging possible tribulations yet promising sanctifying purpose and companionship.<br>
<strong>Section Summary:</strong> The Lord assures Joseph that every imaginable trial—even betrayal, family separation, physical peril, and the jaws of hell—will ultimately yield experience and good if endured faithfully. He reminds Joseph that the Son of Man descended below all things and therefore understands and accompanies him. The revelation concludes with a mandate to "hold on thy way," guaranteeing that God remains with His servant forever.

<strong>Primary Doctrinal Principle:</strong> Trials that seem overwhelming are consecrated for our good when endured in covenant loyalty because the Savior descended below them all (verses 7-9).<br>
<strong>Secondary Principle:</strong> Divine perspective reframes adversity; the Lord knows the limits of opposition and sets bounds that enemies cannot pass (verse 9).<br>
<strong>Application Principle:</strong> Covenant disciples respond to tribulation by holding their course, trusting that the priesthood, God's promises, and heavenly support remain intact despite outward chaos (verses 4, 9).


<h3>Timeframe & Setting</h3>

<h4>Circumstances Among Recipients</h4>
<p>Joseph remained confined in Liberty Jail, physically worn and emotionally stretched. Letters from Emma reported threats, illness among the children, and economic ruin. The Lord's words met Joseph in a moment of profound vulnerability when he envisioned worst-case scenarios: separation from family, violent mobs, and even death. Companions in the jail—Hyrum Smith, Lyman Wight, Caleb Baldwin, and Alexander McRae—shared the revelation, drawing strength from the Lord's assurance that their suffering served a divine curriculum.</p>

<h4>Circumstances Within the Church</h4>
<p>The Saints were scattered along the Mississippi River and through Illinois settlements, uncertain about leadership continuity. Apostles were preparing for missions while in hiding. Many members wondered whether Joseph would survive Missouri's legal onslaught. This section calmed fears by affirming that the Lord still directed the Church and that Joseph's stewardship persisted despite imprisonment.</p>

<h4>Relevant Local Circumstances</h4>
<p>Missouri's hostile environment persisted. Vigilantes menaced Latter-day Saint refugees, and civil authorities continued to press false charges. Families were uprooted, property seized, and mobs emboldened by governmental complicity. Joseph's imagined scenarios in D&C 122 reflect actual threats: kidnappings, assaults, and forced separations.</p>

<h4>Relevant Global Circumstances</h4>
<p>The late 1830s saw global upheaval—economic depressions, political revolutions, and religious ferment. Many believers worldwide faced persecution. D&C 122 situates the Restoration within this broader landscape, presenting adversity as part of a divine plan that prepares Saints for global responsibilities yet to unfold.</p>


<h3>Purpose of the Revelation</h3>

<h4>Short-Term Purpose</h4>
<ul>
<li>Comfort Joseph Smith by acknowledging the full breadth of his fears and testifying that none are beyond Christ's reach.</li>
<li>Strengthen imprisoned leaders so they would not succumb to despair or discouragement.</li>
<li>Encourage scattered Saints to interpret current suffering as sanctifying experience rather than evidence of divine abandonment.</li>
<li>Emphasize that priesthood authority and divine protection remain operative despite physical captivity.</li>

</ul>
<h4>Long-Term Purpose</h4>
<ul>
<li>Provide a doctrinal template for enduring persecution throughout Church history.</li>
<li>Teach successive generations that the Savior has descended below all things and therefore succors His people.</li>
<li>Affirm that opposition has divinely set limits; mortal enemies cannot overrule God's purposes.</li>
<li>Motivate covenant keepers to persevere, knowing their days and years are "known" unto God.</li>


</ul>
<h3>Significance</h3>

<h4>Immediate Significance</h4>
<ul>
<li>Rekindled hope within Liberty Jail, shifting focus from present agony to promised exaltation.</li>
<li>Circulated among the Saints as part of Joseph's letter, helping them interpret forced migrations as refining rather than destructive.</li>
<li>Reinforced loyalty to Joseph by reminding readers that "thy people shall never be turned against thee by the testimony of traitors" (verse 3).</li>

</ul>
<h4>Enduring Significance</h4>
<ul>
<li>Frequently quoted by prophets and apostles to comfort persecuted or suffering Saints worldwide.</li>
<li>Forms doctrinal foundation for Latter-day Saint teachings on adversity, resilience, and Christ's empathy.</li>
<li>Offers a pastoral model for counseling: acknowledge pain, articulate possible scenarios, then promise divine companionship and future vindication.</li>


</ul>
<h3>Cultural Insights</h3>

<h4>Ancient Context</h4>
<p>The Lord's admonition parallels biblical wisdom literature, especially Job's narrative, where righteous suffering refines character. The catalog of calamities echoes Hebrew rhetorical devices that encompass extremes to cover all possibilities. The appeal to the "Son of Man" descending below all things invokes New Testament Christology, aligning Joseph's experience with Jesus' atoning descent.</p>

<h4>Modern Parallels</h4>
<p>Contemporary disciples face threats ranging from family fragmentation to public mockery. D&C 122 teaches believers to interpret such opposition as opportunities for experiential knowledge. The revelation resonates with refugees, prisoners, and marginalized believers who cling to promises that God sets bounds to cruelty and transforms trauma into testimony.</p>

            <div class="panel-content">
<h2>D&C 122: Historical Context</h2>
<h3>From Plea to Promised Perspective in Liberty Jail</h3>


<h3>1. Historical Setting</h3>

<p>D&C 122 is part of the same March 20, 1839 Liberty Jail letter that produced D&C 121 and D&C 123. After Joseph poured out lament, the Lord responded with comfort and doctrinal instruction. Section 122 represents the most personal portion of the letter—God addressing Joseph's fears point by point. The winter had been brutally cold; the jail's stone walls trapped moisture, and smoke from the fireplace often filled the cramped basement cell. Guards taunted the prisoners, occasionally threatening to kill them. Rumors circulated that vigilantes intended to drag Joseph into the night and lynch him.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em;">News from the outside worsened anxiety. Emma reported that militia forces harassed families fleeing Missouri. Joseph learned that some former associates were spreading slander, hoping to delegitimize his leadership. The jail letter shows Joseph wrestling with feelings of isolation yet refusing to abandon faith. The Lord's words in D&C 122 acknowledged every piercing fear while framing suffering within God's eternal purposes.</p>


<h3>2. Key Figures</h3>

<h4>Joseph Smith</h4>
<p>Prophet, prisoner, husband, father—Joseph became the primary addressee of D&C 122. His emotional vulnerability is evident: the Lord references Joseph's wife Emma, his children (including young Joseph III), and potential separation from parents. Joseph's capacity to record the revelation in epistolary form attests to his prophetic discipline even under duress.</p>

<h4>Fellow Prisoners</h4>
<p>Hyrum Smith, Lyman Wight, Caleb Baldwin, Alexander McRae, and Sidney Rigdon (earlier released) shared the jail experience. Their testimonies corroborate the miraculous power of these words to buoy morale. McRae later recounted that the letter "comforted and cheered" them amid imprisonment.</p>

<h4>Traitors and False Witnesses</h4>
<p>The revelation mentions "testimony of traitors" (verse 3), referencing former members such as William W. Phelps and John Whitmer who provided affidavits against Joseph. Some later repented, but at the time their betrayal intensified danger.</p>

<h4>Emma Hale Smith and Family</h4>
<p>Emma navigated illness among children, loss of property, and threats from mobs while living in Far West and later Quincy. Her letters fueled Joseph's grief but also his resolve. The Lord's compassionate words in verse 7 about enemies tearing Joseph from his family reflect Emma's reports and Joseph's nightmares.</p>


<h3>3. Cultural and Religious Context</h3>

<p>American society in 1839 grappled with notions of religious liberty. Latter-day Saints' communal solidarity and new scripture aroused suspicion among Protestant neighbors. Accusations of political block voting and abolitionist sympathies fueled tension. D&C 122 addresses these cultural anxieties indirectly by reaffirming that faithful Saints cannot be permanently turned by traitorous testimonies.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em;">The revelation also engages biblical tradition. By mentioning Job and the Son of Man, the Lord situates Joseph within a long line of suffering prophets and righteous sufferers. Nineteenth-century Americans frequently interpreted affliction through the lens of providence; D&C 122 contributes a uniquely Restoration perspective: adversity is not merely tolerated but consecrated for experience and good.</p>


<h3>4. Political and Social Dynamics</h3>

<p>Executive Order 44 remained in effect, granting militia legal cover to expel Latter-day Saints. Many members were robbed or forced to sign over property. Courts sympathetic to anti-Mormon sentiment refused to hear Saints' petitions. D&C 122's imagery of robbers, false brethren, and the jaws of hell reflects actual social threats. Prisoners recounted that guards bragged about participating in the Haun's Mill massacre; others discussed plans to assault Emma. The letter served as a divine counter-narrative: while human systems failed, God maintained ultimate authority.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em;">In Quincy, Illinois, civic leaders and citizens formed committees to aid the refugees. Their compassion provided a temporary haven, showing that not all neighbors were hostile. This hospitality likely influenced Joseph's determination to keep holding on—there was a future work to accomplish once liberated.</p>


<h3>5. Geographic Context</h3>

<p>Liberty Jail sat near the Clay County courthouse square, about 30 miles from Far West and nearly 200 miles from Quincy. Winter storms often made travel impossible, delaying letters and supplies. The jail's thick walls muffled outside sounds, intensifying isolation. Visits from Emma required long, treacherous journeys; she often left children with friends in nearby counties. The Missouri River, referenced in verse 7's imagery of "billowing surge," flowed a short distance from Liberty—a daily reminder of God's unstoppable purposes.</p>


<h3>6. Timeline Highlights (Nov 1838 – Apr 1839)</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>November 13-28, 1838:</strong> Prisoners confined in Richmond; hear excruciating testimony from guards about atrocities.</li>
<li><strong>December 1, 1838:</strong> Transfer to Liberty Jail; conditions quickly prove harsh.</li>
<li><strong>January 1839:</strong> Emma and other family members visit; Joseph records the poisoning incident.</li>
<li><strong>February 1839:</strong> Sidney Rigdon released on bail due to poor health; Joseph continues to petition courts.</li>
<li><strong>March 20, 1839:</strong> Joseph drafts the letter containing D&C 121-123, including the promises now canonized.</li>
<li><strong>April 6-7, 1839:</strong> Guards transport prisoners toward Boone County; they later allow an "escape," ending the confinement.</li>
<li><strong>April 22, 1839:</strong> Joseph reunites with Emma in Quincy; the Saints begin planning the Nauvoo settlement.</li>

<h4>Scripture Text</h4>
<strong><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/122.1?lang=eng">Doctrine & Covenants 122:1</a></strong> — "The ends of the earth shall inquire after thy name, and fools shall have thee in derision, and hell shall rage against thee;"

<strong><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/122.2?lang=eng">Doctrine & Covenants 122:2</a></strong> — "While the pure in heart, and the wise, and the noble, and the virtuous, shall seek counsel, and authority, and blessings constantly from under thy hand."

<strong><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/122.3?lang=eng">Doctrine & Covenants 122:3</a></strong> — "And thy people shall never be turned against thee by the testimony of traitors."

<h4>Doctrinal Summary</h4>
<p>The Lord prophesies that Joseph's name will attract global attention—admiration from the faithful and mockery from scoffers. Spiritual opposition will rage, yet simultaneously the pure in heart will seek guidance through Joseph's prophetic ministry. Verse 3 promises that loyal Saints will not be swayed by apostate accusations. God separates the reactions of "fools" and "the wise," indicating that discernment hinges on the condition of the heart.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em;">These verses comfort Joseph by validating his influence while acknowledging hostility. Leadership in the kingdom brings simultaneous honor and derision. The Lord assures Joseph that covenant people possess spiritual sensitivity to distinguish truth from slander. This assurance extends to all called leaders who fear betrayal—their stewardship remains intact when they walk uprightly.</p>

<h4>Language & Cultural Insights</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/derision">derision</a></strong> stems from Latin <em>deridere</em> "to laugh at"; scripturally, mockery of prophets fulfills patterns seen with Noah, Lehi, and Paul.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4680/kjv/tr/0-1/">sophos</a></strong> (σοφός) — Greek for "wise." New Testament usage links wisdom with receptivity to divine counsel; fools reject prophetic voices (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/1co/1/27/">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>).</li>
<li>Cultural note: Early Latter-day Saints faced public caricature; newspapers lampooned Joseph. The Lord's prophecy validated that such ridicule was foreseen.</li>

</ul>
<h4>Cross-References</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/act/28/22/">Acts 28:22</a> — The early Church was "everywhere spoken against," paralleling verse 1.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/3.3?lang=eng">Doctrine & Covenants 3:3</a> — God's work cannot be frustrated despite opposition.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/33.1-2?lang=eng">2 Nephi 33:1-2</a> — The Spirit carries words to the hearts of the righteous, but some cast them aside; similar dichotomy.</li>

</ul>
<h4>Reflection Questions</h4>
<p>1. How do I respond when prophetic voices receive derision in the public square?</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em;">2. In what ways can I seek counsel and blessings from under prophetic hands more diligently?</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em;">3. How do I guard myself against entertaining the "testimony of traitors" in modern contexts (blogs, social media, rumors)?</p>

<h4>Scripture Text</h4>
<strong><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/122.4?lang=eng">Doctrine & Covenants 122:4</a></strong> — "And although their influence shall cast thee into trouble, and into bars and walls, thou shalt be had in honor; and but for a small moment and thy voice shall be more terrible in the midst of thine enemies than the fierce lion, because of thy righteousness; and thy God shall stand by thee forever and ever."

<strong><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/122.5?lang=eng">Doctrine & Covenants 122:5</a></strong> — "If thou art called to pass through tribulation; if thou art in perils among false brethren; if thou art in perils among robbers; if thou art in perils by land or by sea;"

<strong><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/122.6?lang=eng">Doctrine & Covenants 122:6</a></strong> — "If thou art accused with all manner of false accusations; if thine enemies fall upon thee; if they tear thee from the society of thy father and mother and brethren and sisters; and if with a drawn sword thine enemies tear thee from the bosom of thy wife, and of thine offspring, and thine elder son, although but six years of age, shall cling to thy garments, and shall say, My father, my father, why can't you stay with us? O, my father, what are the men going to do with you? and if then he shall be thrust from thee by the sword, and thou be dragged to prison, and thine enemies prowl around thee like wolves for the blood of the lamb;"

<h4>Doctrinal Summary</h4>
<p>The Lord acknowledges that wicked influence has placed Joseph behind "bars and walls," yet promises future honor. Even while imprisoned, Joseph's testimony will roar like a lion because righteousness amplifies spiritual authority. Verses 5-6 list escalating calamities—betrayal, robbery, violent assault, forcible separation from family—culminating in a heart-wrenching depiction of young Joseph III clinging to his father. God does not minimize these scenarios; He names them, validating the prophet's fears.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em;">By detailing possible sufferings, the Lord demonstrates omniscient empathy. He stands by Joseph "forever and ever," offering presence even when deliverance tarries. The dramatic imagery of wolves circling the lamb frames Joseph as a Christlike sufferer whose sacrifice strengthens the Saints. These verses teach that acknowledging grief is not faithless; rather, it invites divine solidarity.</p>

<h4>Language & Cultural Insights</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2347/kjv/tr/0-1/">thlipsis</a></strong> (θλῖψις) — Greek for "tribulation, pressure." Paul's writings mirror the "if thou art called to pass through tribulation" phrasing.</li>
<li>The lion metaphor evokes <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/pro/28/1/">Proverbs 28:1</a>—"the righteous are bold as a lion"—asserting moral courage even in confinement.</li>
<li>Cultural note: Frontier America feared kidnappings and mob violence; the Lord references real threats to highlight His awareness.</li>

<p>1. Which "if thou" scenario resonates with my current or anticipated trials?</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em;">2. How does the promise that God "shall stand by thee forever" alter my sense of isolation?</p>

<strong><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/122.7?lang=eng">Doctrine & Covenants 122:7</a></strong> — "And if thou shouldst be cast into the pit, or into the hands of murderers, and the sentence of death passed upon thee; if thou be cast into the deep; if the billowing surge conspire against thee; if fierce winds become thine enemy; if the heavens gather blackness, and all the elements combine to hedge up the way; and above all, if the very jaws of hell shall gape open the mouth wide after thee, know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good."

Thy days are known, and thy years shall not be numbered less; therefore, fear not what man can do, for God shall be with you forever and ever."

<h4>Doctrinal Summary</h4>
<p>The Lord culminates His message with sweeping assurance. Every conceivable disaster—even cosmic upheaval—can be consecrated for good. The Savior's empathetic authority rests on firsthand experience; He descended below all things, so no disciple's suffering exceeds His comprehension. Verse 8 invites humility: if Christ endured, so can His servants.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em;">Verse 9 issues a commission: "hold on thy way." Priesthood authority remains; enemies have divinely set limits. God knows Joseph's days and guarantees that mortality will not end prematurely. Fear of man dissipates because divine companionship is perpetual. These verses constitute one of the Restoration's most powerful teachings on redemptive suffering.</p>
