                <h2>Section Overview</h2>
                
                <h3>Basic Information</h3>
                <p><strong>Date of Revelation:</strong> October 12, 1833</p>
                <p><strong>Location:</strong> Perrysburg, New York</p>
                <p><strong>Recipients:</strong> Joseph Smith the Prophet and Sidney Rigdon</p>
                <p><strong>Section Summary:</strong> The Lord reassures Joseph and Sidney about their families' welfare during their mission to Canada, defines their complementary roles as revelator and spokesman, and promises that Zion will be redeemed despite temporary chastening.</p>
                
                <h3>Key Principles</h3>
                <p><strong>Primary Doctrinal Principle:</strong> The Lord provides for missionaries' families and gives His servants the very words to speak in the moment they are needed.</p>
                <p><strong>Secondary Principle:</strong> Different members of the Church have complementary spiritual gifts that work together for the building of the kingdom.</p>
                <p><strong>Application Principle:</strong> When we follow the Lord's counsel and continue forward in faith, He is with us "even unto the end" and causes all things to work together for good.</p>
                
                <h3>Timeframe & Setting</h3>
                
                <h4>Circumstances Among Recipients</h4>
                <p>Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon had been traveling for eight days on a mission to Upper Canada, leaving Kirtland on October 4, 1833. Both men felt anxious about their families—Joseph had left pregnant Emma with their young children, and Sidney had left his wife and several children. They were stopping in Perrysburg, New York, near Buffalo, when they sought the Lord about their concerns. Despite their worries, they pressed forward with their missionary duties.</p>
                
                <h4>Circumstances Within the Church</h4>
                <p>The Church was experiencing simultaneous growth and severe persecution. While missionaries like Joseph and Sidney expanded the work in new areas, the Saints in Jackson County, Missouri, faced increasing violence. The July destruction of the printing press had scattered the revelations being prepared for publication. Members struggled to understand why Zion was suffering when they were trying to build it according to revelation. Questions arose about how to balance family responsibilities with missionary calls.</p>
                
                <h4>Relevant Local Circumstances</h4>
                <p>Western New York and Upper Canada represented potential growth areas for the Church. The region had been influenced by religious revivalism, making some receptive to new religious messages. Transportation improvements like the Erie Canal facilitated travel but journeys still took days or weeks. Economic depression in the region created both opportunities and challenges for missionary work. Local ministers often stirred up opposition when Mormon missionaries arrived.</p>

                <p>The 1830s marked a period of religious experimentation and communal societies in America. Democratic ideals were spreading globally, influencing religious movements toward egalitarianism. Transportation improvements were connecting previously isolated regions. The Industrial Revolution was changing social structures, creating spiritual hunger among displaced populations. Political tensions between the United States and British Canada affected cross-border religious movements.</p>

                <h2>Historical Context</h2>
                
                <h3>The Journey to Perrysburg</h3>
                <p>Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon departed Kirtland, Ohio, on October 4, 1833, embarking on what would become a pivotal missionary journey to Upper Canada. Their route took them through the Western Reserve of Ohio, along the southern shore of Lake Erie, and into western New York. Eight days into their journey, they arrived in Perrysburg, a small settlement near Buffalo.</p>
                
                <div class="info-box">
                    <h4>Key Background: The Freeman Nickerson Connection</h4>
                    <p>Freeman Nickerson, a recent convert to the Church, hosted Joseph and Sidney in Perrysburg. His hospitality provided the setting for this important revelation. Freeman's son, Moses Nickerson, would later become a faithful elder through the influence of this visit.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h3>Family Concerns</h3>
                <p>Both men carried heavy hearts about their families left behind in Kirtland:</p>
                
                <h4>Joseph's Family Situation</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Emma Smith:</strong> Six months pregnant with their fourth child (Frederick Granger Williams Smith, born June 1834)</li>
                    <li><strong>Julia Murdock Smith:</strong> Adopted daughter, age 2½</li>
                    <li><strong>Joseph Smith III:</strong> Almost 11 months old</li>
                    <li><strong>Additional concerns:</strong> Emma was managing the household alone during a time of increasing local opposition</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Sidney's Family Situation</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Phebe Rigdon:</strong> Sidney's wife, in delicate health with recurring illnesses</li>
                    <li><strong>Children:</strong> Including Sidney Jr. (age 16), Eliza (14), and several younger children</li>
                    <li><strong>Household management:</strong> Phebe was managing a large family without Sidney's support</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>The Church in October 1833</h3>
                
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>Critical Context: Unknown Missouri Crisis</h4>
                    <p>As Joseph and Sidney received this revelation, they were unaware that conditions in Missouri were deteriorating rapidly. Within weeks, the Saints would be driven from Jackson County entirely. The Lord's promise that "Zion shall be redeemed" would provide crucial hope when this news reached them.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h4>Temple Construction in Kirtland</h4>
                <p>The Kirtland Temple foundation had been laid on July 23, 1833, but construction proceeded slowly due to limited resources. Local opposition to the temple was growing, with threats against workers becoming increasingly common. This added to the missionaries' concerns about their families' safety.</p>
                
                <h4>Doctrinal Development</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The School of the Prophets had been organized earlier in 1833</li>
                    <li>The Word of Wisdom (D&C 89) had been revealed in February</li>
                    <li>The missionary force was expanding throughout North America</li>
                    <li>Plans were developing for overseas missions</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>The Mission to Upper Canada</h3>
                
                <h4>Geographic and Political Context</h4>
                <p>The mission to Canada required crossing into British territory, just twenty years after the War of 1812. Religious movements crossing the border were viewed with suspicion by both governments. Despite these challenges, the region offered significant missionary potential:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The "Burned-over District":</strong> Western New York had experienced so many religious revivals that people were said to be hardened to religious enthusiasm</li>
                    <li><strong>Erie Canal influence:</strong> Completed in 1825, the canal made travel faster and cheaper</li>
                    <li><strong>Economic conditions:</strong> Regional economic depression created both spiritual hunger and practical challenges</li>
                    <li><strong>Religious competition:</strong> Multiple new religious movements were active in the area</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Complementary Roles Defined</h3>
                
                <div class="info-box">
                    <h4>The Spokesman and Revelator Pattern</h4>
                    <p>This revelation formally acknowledged what had been developing naturally in the Church leadership structure:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Joseph as Revelator:</strong> Receiving divine communications and visions</li>
                        <li><strong>Sidney as Spokesman:</strong> Powerful preacher and scripture expositor</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This pattern would influence future Church organization, establishing the model of presidents and counselors with complementary gifts.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h3>The Promise of Divine Words</h3>
                <p>The Lord's promise that He would give them words "in the very hour, yea, in the very moment" addressed a practical concern. Joseph and Sidney would face hostile audiences, difficult questions, and educated critics. This promise echoed Christ's assurance to His apostles and would be fulfilled repeatedly during their mission.</p>
                
                <h3>Mission Success and Converts</h3>
                <p>Following this revelation, Joseph and Sidney continued into Upper Canada with renewed confidence. They preached in several communities including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mount Pleasant</li>
                    <li>Brantford</li>
                    <li>Colborne</li>
                    <li>Other settlements in Ontario</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Several branches were established, and influential converts joined the Church. The "effectual door" mentioned in the revelation was literally fulfilled as many received their message despite opposition.</p>
                
                <h3>Global Context of 1833</h3>
                
                <h4>Religious and Social Movements</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Abolition movement:</strong> Britain had just passed the Slavery Abolition Act, ending slavery in most of the British Empire including Canada</li>
                    <li><strong>Second Great Awakening:</strong> Producing numerous new religious movements</li>
                    <li><strong>Millerite movement:</strong> Predicting Christ's return in 1843-1844</li>
                    <li><strong>Campbellites (Disciples of Christ):</strong> Growing rapidly, from which Sidney Rigdon had converted</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Transportation Revolution</h4>
                <p>The 1830s saw dramatic improvements in transportation that facilitated missionary work:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Erie Canal connecting New York to the Great Lakes</li>
                    <li>Steamboats becoming common on major waterways</li>
                    <li>Road improvements allowing faster overland travel</li>
                    <li>These advances allowed missionaries to cover more territory but also meant opposition could organize more quickly</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>The Fulfillment of Promises</h3>
                
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>Divine Promises Kept</h4>
                    <p>The Lord's promises in this revelation were remarkably fulfilled:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Family protection:</strong> Both families remained safe during the missionaries' absence</li>
                        <li><strong>Effectual door:</strong> Multiple branches established in Canada</li>
                        <li><strong>Words given in the moment:</strong> Documented instances of inspired responses to critics</li>
                        <li><strong>Hearts rejoicing:</strong> The mission strengthened both men's faith</li>
                        <li><strong>Zion's redemption:</strong> Though delayed, the promise sustained the Saints through trials</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                
                <h3>Long-term Impact</h3>
                <p>This revelation established patterns that continue in the modern Church:</p>

                </ul>
                <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Biblical meekness (עֲנָוָה anavah) is not weakness but rather humility combined with virtue and strength. The Hebrew חַיִל (chayil)—translated as "virtuous" in Proverbs 31:10—encompasses moral excellence, strength, and noble character. When these qualities combine with humility (anavah), it reveals that true meekness is virtuous power exercised with restraint and wisdom under God's direction. Moses exemplified this—called the meekest man yet displaying tremendous strength and leadership. It invites the Spirit's confirming witness.</p>
