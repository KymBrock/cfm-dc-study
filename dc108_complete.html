            <h2>Section Overview</h2>
            
            <h3>Basic Information</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Date of Revelation:</strong> December 26, 1835</li>
                <li><strong>Location:</strong> Kirtland, Ohio</li>
                <li><strong>Recipient(s):</strong> Lyman Sherman, through Joseph Smith</li>
                <li><strong>Section Summary:</strong> The Lord forgives Lyman Sherman's sins, calls him to strengthen his brethren, preach the gospel, and promises that if he continues faithful, he will have the right to preach wherever the Lord sends him, with future ordination to the Seventy promised.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Key Principles</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Primary Doctrinal Principle:</strong> Past sins need not prevent future service when there is genuine repentance and the Lord's voice of forgiveness</li>
                <li><strong>Secondary Principle:</strong> Strengthening others in conversation, prayer, and exhortation represents core priesthood duty</li>
                <li><strong>Application Principle:</strong> Patient waiting for solemn assemblies and proper ordination demonstrates faith and prepares servants for greater responsibilities</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Timeframe & Setting</h3>
            
            <h4>Circumstances Among Recipients</h4>
            <p>Lyman Sherman had come to Joseph Smith deeply troubled about his standing before the Lord, feeling he had committed serious sins. He had previously been ordained a high priest and served faithfully, including participation in Zion's Camp (1834). His conscience was so troubled that he sought a personal revelation through the Prophet to know his status. This humble seeking occurred just three months before the Kirtland Temple dedication.</p>
            
            <h4>Circumstances Within the Church</h4>
            <p>December 1835 found the Church in intense preparation for the Kirtland Temple dedication (March 1836). The School of the Prophets was meeting regularly. The Doctrine and Covenants was being prepared for publication (1835 edition). Priesthood quorums were being organized according to D&C 107 (received March 1835). The promise of a solemn assembly where endowments would be given created anticipation among faithful elders.</p>
            
            <h4>Relevant Local Circumstances</h4>
            <p>Kirtland's population had swelled with gathering Saints, creating economic strain but spiritual excitement. The temple construction had required enormous sacrifice—workers often laboring while fasting, women providing china for the plaster. Opposition from Protestant ministers was increasing as the temple neared completion. Yet a spirit of unity prevailed among the Saints as they anticipated promised blessings.</p>
            
            <h4>Relevant Global Circumstances</h4>
            <p>The 1830s marked increasing democratization of religion in America, with camp meetings and revivals emphasizing personal salvation experiences. The concept of continuing revelation through prophets challenged Protestant cessationism. Social reform movements, including temperance and abolition, were gaining momentum. Economic uncertainty following the Panic of 1837 was beginning to loom.</p>
            
            <h3>Purpose of the Revelation</h3>
            
            <h4>Short Term</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide Lyman Sherman with assurance of divine forgiveness</li>
                <li>Give him specific duties to strengthen his brethren</li>
                <li>Promise him future ordination among the leading elders</li>
                <li>Prepare him spiritually for the solemn assembly</li>
                <li>Demonstrate that personal revelations could come through the Prophet</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Long Term</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Establish the pattern that forgiven sins don't disqualify from future service</li>
                <li>Show the importance of strengthening brethren in all forms of interaction</li>
                <li>Demonstrate that ordinations should wait for proper assemblies</li>
                <li>Teach that patient preparation precedes greater responsibilities</li>
                <li>Provide comfort to all who worry about past sins limiting future service</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Significance</h3>
            
            <h4>Short Term</h4>
            <p>Lyman Sherman received the peace he desperately sought, knowing his sins were forgiven. He was ordained to the First Quorum of Seventy on February 28, 1836, at the solemn assembly mentioned in the revelation. His service in strengthening the brethren contributed to the spiritual outpouring at the temple dedication. His faithful response validated the principle of personal revelation through the Prophet.</p>
            
            <h4>Long Term</h4>
            <p>This revelation continues to comfort those who fear past sins disqualify them from service. The command to "strengthen brethren in all your conversation, in all your prayers, in all your exhortations, and in all your doings" has become a template for priesthood ministry. The pattern of waiting patiently for proper ordination maintains order in the Church. Sadly, Lyman Sherman died in 1839 at age 35, but his brief faithful service following this revelation exemplifies consecrated discipleship.</p>
            
            <h3>Cultural Insights</h3>
            
            <h4>Ancient Patterns</h4>
            <p>The pattern of seeking prophetic assurance about one's standing before God echoes David's psalms of repentance and Old Testament figures seeking divine oracles. The command to strengthen brethren reflects the ancient role of priests teaching and encouraging Israel. The concept of solemn assemblies dates to Mosaic gatherings at the tabernacle. Waiting for proper ordination mirrors Samuel anointing David long before he became king.</p>
            
            <h4>Modern Relevance</h4>
            <p>Today's members often struggle with feeling worthy after repentance, making Lyman's experience deeply relatable. The multifaceted command to strengthen others (conversation, prayers, exhortations, doings) provides a comprehensive ministry model. The principle of patient waiting for calls and ordinations helps anxious members trust in divine timing. The revelation shows that personal revelations through priesthood leaders remain available.</p>

            <h2>Historical Context</h2>
            
            <h3>December 1835: Temple Anticipation</h3>
            
            <h4>The Setting</h4>
            <p>The day after Christmas 1835, Lyman Sherman approached Joseph Smith with a heavy heart. The Kirtland Temple stood nearly complete, its dedication just three months away. The Saints were preparing spiritually and temporally for the promised endowment of power. Into this atmosphere of anticipation came Lyman, burdened with guilt over past sins.</p>
            
            <h4>Lyman Sherman's Background</h4>
            <p>Lyman Sherman was no newcomer to the faith. Born in 1804, he had joined the Church in 1832 and was ordained a high priest the same year. He served faithfully in Zion's Camp in 1834, marching with Joseph Smith to Missouri. Despite this service, something weighed heavily on his conscience—sins that made him question his worthiness before God.</p>
            
            <h4>The Nature of Personal Revelations</h4>
            <p>This revelation demonstrates an important pattern: individuals could receive personal revelations through the Prophet. Joseph didn't simply offer counsel; he inquired of the Lord and received specific revelation for Lyman. This pattern would continue throughout Joseph's ministry, though few of these personal revelations were canonized.</p>
            
            <h3>Preparing for the Solemn Assembly</h3>
            
            <h4>Organizational Preparations</h4>
            <p>The Church was organizing according to the pattern revealed in D&C 107 (March 1835). The Quorum of the Twelve had been called, the Seventy were being organized, and priesthood offices were being clarified. Lyman's promised ordination to be "numbered with" the leading elders would be fulfilled at the solemn assembly.</p>
            
            <h4>Spiritual Preparations</h4>
            <p>The School of the Prophets was meeting in the temple, even before its dedication. Members were being taught the order of heaven, practicing washing of feet, and preparing for sacred ordinances. The emphasis on personal worthiness made Lyman's concerns especially poignant.</p>
            
            <h4>Economic Sacrifices</h4>
            <p>Building the temple had required enormous sacrifice. Members had given money, labor, and materials. Women crushed their china to mix with plaster for the temple walls. Men worked on the temple while their farms suffered. In this context of sacrifice, Lyman worried whether his offerings were acceptable.</p>
            
            <h3>The Revelation's Immediate Impact</h3>
            
            <h4>Personal Peace</h4>
            <p>The revelation brought Lyman immediate relief: "Your sins are forgiven you, and you are a clean man before me; therefore, lift up your head and rejoice." This divine assurance transformed his countenance and renewed his dedication to the work.</p>
            
            <h4>Ministry Focus</h4>
            <p>The specific command to strengthen brethren "in all your conversation, in all your prayers, in all your exhortations, and in all your doings" gave Lyman clear direction. This wasn't just about formal teaching but infusing strengthening power into every interaction.</p>
            
            <h4>Fulfilled Promise</h4>
            <p>On February 28, 1836, at the solemn assembly mentioned in verse 4, Lyman Sherman was ordained one of the Presidents of the Seventy. The Lord's promise was literally fulfilled within two months of the revelation.</p>
            
            <h3>Broader Historical Significance</h3>
            
            <h4>Pattern for Repentance</h4>
            <p>This revelation established that past sins, once repented of and forgiven, need not disqualify individuals from significant Church service. Many early Church leaders had checkered pasts before conversion or had made mistakes after baptism. Lyman's experience showed the reality of forgiveness.</p>
            
            <h4>Ministry Model</h4>
            <p>The comprehensive nature of strengthening others—in conversation, prayers, exhortations, and doings—became a model for priesthood service. It wasn't enough to teach correct doctrine; priesthood holders must strengthen others through every form of interaction.</p>
            
            <h4>Tragic Conclusion</h4>
            <p>Lyman Sherman served faithfully as a Seventy until his death on January 27, 1839, at age 35, likely from consumption (tuberculosis). His widow Delcena later became a plural wife of Joseph Smith. Though his mortal ministry was brief, his revelation continues to bless those seeking assurance of divine forgiveness.</p>
            
            <h3>Contemporary Religious Context</h3>
            
            <h4>Revivalism and Personal Salvation</h4>
            <p>The Second Great Awakening emphasized personal salvation experiences. Camp meetings featured dramatic conversions and assurances of salvation. Lyman's revelation fit this cultural pattern while adding the unique element of revelation through a prophet.</p>
            
            <h4>Perfectionism Movements</h4>
            <p>Various religious groups in the 1830s taught forms of perfectionism—the idea that Christians could achieve sinless perfection. Lyman's revelation balanced this by acknowledging past sins while emphasizing moving forward in faith rather than achieving perfection.</p>
            
            <h3>Lessons from Lyman Sherman</h3>
            
            <h4>Courage to Seek</h4>
            <p>Lyman had the courage to approach the Prophet about his spiritual concerns. Many suffer in silence, but Lyman sought divine guidance through proper channels.</p>
            
            <h4>Power of Forgiveness</h4>
            <p>The Lord's declaration "you are a clean man before me" shows the completeness of divine forgiveness. Past sins need not define future service.</p>
            
            <h4>Patient Preparation</h4>
            <p>Though promised ordination, Lyman had to wait for the proper solemn assembly. This patience demonstrated faith and prepared him for his calling.</p>
