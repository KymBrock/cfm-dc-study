<h2>D&C 123: Section Overview</h2>
<h3>Gathering Testimony and Bearing Witness Amid Persecution</h3>


<h3>Basic Information</h3>
<br>
<strong>Date of Revelation:</strong> March 20, 1839<br>
<strong>Location:</strong> Liberty Jail, Clay County, Missouri<br>
<strong>Recipient:</strong> The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints—leaders and members responsible for documenting suffering<br>
<strong>Context:</strong> Final portion of Joseph Smith's Liberty Jail letter; the Prophet directs Saints to collect affidavits and records of abuses in Missouri to petition governments and inform the world.<br>
<strong>Section Summary:</strong> D&C 123 transforms anguish into action. Joseph charges the Saints to gather detailed accounts of property losses, violence, and slander; to compile names of perpetrators; and to publish the "whole concatenation of diabolical rascality." The Saints must waste and wear out their lives exposing darkness so the nation is left without excuse and God's arm can be revealed. The section ends with a rousing exhortation to do all within their power, then stand still to see God's salvation.


<h3>Key Principles</h3>
<br>
<strong>Primary Doctrinal Principle:</strong> Recording and bearing testimony of injustice is a covenant duty that prepares the way for divine intervention (verses 1-14).<br>
<strong>Secondary Principle:</strong> Saints are commanded to act cheerfully and thoroughly in righteous causes, trusting that God will reveal His arm when they have done all they can (verse 17).<br>
<strong>Application Principle:</strong> Accurate history, faithful advocacy, and persistent diligence are spiritual disciplines that build Zion and safeguard religious liberty.


<h3>Timeframe & Setting</h3>

<h4>Circumstances Among Recipients</h4>
<p>Saints were scattered in refugee settlements, nursing wounds from mob violence, and grieving lost loved ones. Many lacked resources to document losses or access legal recourse. Joseph empowered them to transform trauma into documented testimony. The instruction unified the Saints in purposeful labor even while leadership remained imprisoned.</p>

<h4>Circumstances Within the Church</h4>
<p>Church administration shifted toward Nauvoo. Apostles prepared for missions even as they aided refugees. The command to gather records helped leaders assess needs, seek reparations, and preserve institutional memory. It also reinforced obedience to civil law: petitions would be directed to government "heads" rather than vigilante revenge.</p>

<h4>Relevant Local Circumstances</h4>
<p>Missouri communities celebrated the Saints' removal, while some Missourians who sympathized felt powerless. Legal redress seemed impossible—courts were biased against Latter-day Saints. Joseph's directive emphasized building airtight cases through affidavits, statistics, and published histories, ensuring no abuse remained unexposed.</p>

<h4>Relevant Global Circumstances</h4>
<p>The 19th century saw reform movements centered on abolition, women's rights, and prison reform. Collecting testimonies fueled these causes. Joseph placed the Saints within this broader landscape of moral persuasion: truthful records would enlighten the nation and bolster emerging dialogues about minority rights and religious freedom.</p>


<h3>Purpose of the Revelation</h3>

</ul>
<h3>Cultural Insights</h3>

<h4>Ancient Context</h4>
<p>Prophetic calls to remember and record appear throughout scripture: Israelites kept chronicles of oppression (Exodus), Nephites preserved plates detailing wars and deliverances. Joseph echoes that tradition, framing history as sacred stewardship. The exhortation to publish the "concatenation of diabolical rascality" resembles Old Testament prophetic indictments exposing national sin (e.g., Amos, Jeremiah).</p>

<h4>Modern Parallels</h4>
<p>Modern social justice movements rely on documentation: testimonies, data, and public reports. D&C 123 underscores that faithful activism includes accurate record keeping. The command to do so cheerfully resonates with contemporary advocacy that maintains hope while confronting darkness.</p>

<h3>Key Doctrines</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Record Keeping as Duty:</strong> Saints must gather facts, affidavits, and names so truth prevails (verses 1-6).</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy Before Government:</strong> Presenting evidence to rulers is part of building Zion and leaving the nation without excuse (verses 6-7).</li>
<li><strong>Exposure of Darkness:</strong> Revealing hidden wickedness is a divine mandate, not optional activism (verses 8-13).</li>
<li><strong>Cheerful Perseverance:</strong> Even while exposing injustice, Saints act cheerfully, trusting God's ultimate deliverance (verse 17).</li>
<li><strong>Synergy of Human Effort and Divine Power:</strong> After doing everything possible, disciples stand still to see the salvation of God (verse 17).</li>

        <div class="content-panel">
            <div class="panel-content">
<h2>D&C 123: Historical Context</h2>
<h3>Turning Persecution into Testimony and Legal Petition</h3>


<h3>1. Historical Setting</h3>

<p>D&C 123 closes Joseph Smith's March 20, 1839 Liberty Jail letter. After receiving assurance of God's support (D&C 121-122), Joseph shifted to strategy. The Saints had been expelled from Missouri under the extermination order, leaving property confiscated and hundreds homeless. In Quincy, Illinois, civic leaders extended compassion; however, legal redress required evidence. Joseph therefore issued a prophetic directive: gather comprehensive documentation of abuses—names of perpetrators, details of damages, and copies of slanderous publications.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em;">The Saints had already attempted petitions. In early 1839, delegations visited Missouri's capital but met resistance. Joseph recognized that future appeals to Congress or the President would fail without thorough records. D&C 123 organized the Saints' response, transforming them from victims into historians and advocates.</p>


<h3>2. Key Figures</h3>

<h4>Joseph Smith</h4>
<p>From jail, Joseph orchestrated record keeping. He requested sworn statements from refugees and directed leaders to compile lists. His vision extended beyond immediate relief; he anticipated future narratives that would vindicate the Saints and instruct posterity.</p>

<h4>Hyrum Smith & Liberty Jail Companions</h4>
<p>They co-signed the letter, lending apostolic authority to the directive. Their faith in record keeping underscored that administration continued despite imprisonment.</p>

<h4>Bishop Edward Partridge & Other Leaders</h4>
<p>Partridge, the presiding bishop, coordinated welfare in Quincy and facilitated collection of affidavits. Apostles including Brigham Young and Heber C. Kimball later used the data to petition President Martin Van Buren in November 1839.</p>

<h4>Widows, Orphans, and Refugees</h4>
<p>The revelation explicitly mentions widows and fatherless children who had suffered. Their testimonies provided moral weight to the petitions. Women such as Amanda Barnes Smith and survivors of Haun's Mill supplied harrowing accounts that reached national audiences.</p>


<h3>3. Cultural and Religious Context</h3>

<p>American reform movements relied on testimonials—abolitionists published slave narratives; women's rights advocates documented legal inequities. Joseph's call mirrors this tactic: truth telling catalyzes change. The Saints' dual identity as religious minority and frontier settlers meant they had to navigate suspicion about communal living, new scripture, and political bloc voting. D&C 123 teaches that transparency and documentation counteract prejudice.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em;">Religiously, the section resonates with scriptural mandates to remember captivity and deliverance (Deuteronomy 5). Joseph invited the Saints to craft a collective memory that would fortify faith and inform governance. The call to publish the "concatenation of diabolical rascality" reflects prophetic tradition—naming sin publicly to invite repentance.</p>


<h3>4. Political and Social Dynamics</h3>

<p>After Executive Order 44, Missouri militia and mobs seized property, burned homes, and committed violence with impunity. Courts rarely prosecuted offenders. The Saints hoped federal authorities would intervene, but President Van Buren later famously responded, "Your cause is just, but I can do nothing for you." D&C 123 anticipates such reluctance and insists on exhaustive evidence to eliminate governmental excuses.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em;">The revelation also aimed to influence public opinion. Newspapers carried competing narratives; anti-Mormon editors portrayed the Saints as aggressors. Joseph's directive countered misinformation by urging Saints to collect defamatory publications and expose falsehoods. The resulting records were later published in works such as <em>History of the Persecution of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Missouri</em> (1839) and Parley P. Pratt's memoirs.</p>


<h3>5. Geographic Context</h3>

<p>Gathering evidence required coordination across dispersed settlements. Refugees in Quincy, Adams County, Illinois; Commerce (later Nauvoo); and outlying Iowa territories collected affidavits. Many documents were sworn before Illinois justices of the peace to lend legal credibility. Couriers carried statements to Joseph in Liberty Jail and later to Washington, D.C. The geographic dispersal of Saints necessitated systematic record keeping—hence the Lord's command to appoint committees.</p>


<h3>6. Timeline of Key Actions (March 1839 – February 1840)</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>March 20, 1839:</strong> Joseph dictates D&C 123 in Liberty Jail.</li>
<li><strong>April 1839:</strong> After escaping custody, Joseph regroups in Quincy; leaders begin organized data collection.</li>
<li><strong>May 1839:</strong> Saints purchase land at Commerce, Illinois, while continuing to gather testimonies.</li>
<li><strong>Summer 1839:</strong> Apostles compile affidavits; Church printer begins preparing pamphlets.</li>
<li><strong>October 28, 1839:</strong> Joseph, Sidney Rigdon, and Elias Higbee depart for Washington, D.C., carrying compiled documents.</li>
<li><strong>November 29, 1839:</strong> Delegation meets President Van Buren; petitions presented but dismissed.</li>
<li><strong>January-February 1840:</strong> Hearings before Senate and House committees rely on collected affidavits; no federal relief granted, but the historical record is preserved.</li>


</ul>
<h3>Primary Sources & Outcomes</h3>

<ul>
<li>The Saints' documentation culminated in the 1840 publication <em>Memorial to the United States Senate and House of Representatives</em>, containing dozens of affidavits.</li>
<li>Amanda Barnes Smith's Haun's Mill testimony influenced public sympathy despite lack of legal redress.</li>
<li>D&C 123's emphasis on writing helped later historians compile <em>History of the Church</em> and modern <em>Saints</em> volumes.</li>

<h4>Scripture Text</h4>
<strong><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/123.1?lang=eng">Doctrine & Covenants 123:1</a></strong> — "And again, we would suggest for your consideration the propriety of all the saints gathering up a knowledge of all the facts, and sufferings and abuses put upon them by the people of this State;"

<strong><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/123.2?lang=eng">Doctrine & Covenants 123:2</a></strong> — "And also of all the property and amount of damages which they have sustained, both of character and personal injuries, as well as real property;"

<strong><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/123.3?lang=eng">Doctrine & Covenants 123:3</a></strong> — "And also the names of all persons that have had a hand in their oppressions, as far as they can get hold of them and find them out."

<strong><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/123.4?lang=eng">Doctrine & Covenants 123:4</a></strong> — "And perhaps a committee can be appointed to find out these things, and to take statements and affidavits; and also to gather up the libelous publications that are afloat;"

<strong><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/123.5?lang=eng">Doctrine & Covenants 123:5</a></strong> — "And all that are in the magazines, and in the encyclopedias, and all the libelous histories that are published, and are writing, and by whom, and present the whole concatenation of diabolical rascality and nefarious and murderous impositions that have been practiced upon this people—"

<strong><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/123.6?lang=eng">Doctrine & Covenants 123:6</a></strong> — "That we may not only publish to all the world, but present them to the heads of government in all their dark and hellish hue, as the last effort which is enjoined on us by our Heavenly Father, before we can fully and completely claim that promise which shall call him forth from his hiding place; and also that the whole nation may be left without excuse before he can send forth the power of his mighty arm."

<h4>Doctrinal Summary</h4>
<p>The Saints are commanded to document every fact of their suffering: losses of property, slander against character, physical injuries, and the names of perpetrators. Joseph envisions organized effort—a committee to gather affidavits and collect defamatory publications. The colorful phrase "concatenation of diabolical rascality" underscores the magnitude of injustice.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em;">Publishing truth serves dual purposes: informing the world and petitioning government leaders. Obedience to this directive is framed as a divine injunction—required before claiming God's promised intervention. Documentation removes excuses from the nation and invites the Lord to "send forth the power of his mighty arm."</p>

<h4>Scripture Text</h4>
<strong><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/123.7?lang=eng">Doctrine & Covenants 123:7</a></strong> — "It is an imperative duty that we owe to God, to angels, with whom we shall be brought to stand, and also to ourselves, to our wives and children, who have been made to bow down with grief, sorrow, and care, under the most damning hand of murder, tyranny, and oppression, supported and urged on and upheld by the influence of that spirit which hath so strongly riveted the creeds of the fathers, who have inherited lies, upon the hearts of the children, and filled the world with confusion, and has been growing stronger and stronger, and is now the very mainspring of all corruption, and the whole earth groans under the weight of its iniquity."

<strong><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/123.8?lang=eng">Doctrine & Covenants 123:8</a></strong> — "It is an iron yoke, it is a strong band; they are the very handcuffs, and chains, and shackles, and fetters of hell."

<strong><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/123.9?lang=eng">Doctrine & Covenants 123:9</a></strong> — "Therefore it is an imperative duty that we owe, not only to our own wives and children, but to the widows and fatherless, whose husbands and fathers have been murdered under its iron hand;"

<strong><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/123.10?lang=eng">Doctrine & Covenants 123:10</a></strong> — "Which dark and blackening deeds are enough to make hell itself shudder, and to stand aghast and pale, and the hands of the very devil to tremble and palsy."

<strong><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/123.11?lang=eng">Doctrine & Covenants 123:11</a></strong> — "And also it is an imperative duty that we owe to all the rising generation, and to all the pure in heart—"

<strong><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/123.12?lang=eng">Doctrine & Covenants 123:12</a></strong> — "For there are many yet on the earth among all sects, parties, and denominations, who are blinded by the subtle craftiness of men, whereby they lie in wait to deceive, and who are only kept from the truth because they know not where to find it—"

<h4>Doctrinal Summary</h4>
<p>The Lord elevates record keeping to a sacred duty owed to God, angels, family, widows, fatherless, future generations, and seekers of truth. Oppression is described as an "iron yoke"—chains forged by inherited lies and corrupt tradition. Joseph insists that exposing evil honors those who suffered and frees those still trapped in ignorance.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em;">The Saints must act not only for themselves but on behalf of widows and orphans whose protectors were slain. The language evokes cosmic reaction: hell shudders, the devil trembles when such atrocities are revealed. Moreover, honest testimony helps sincere seekers break free from deception, locating truth they otherwise cannot find.</p>

<h4>Doctrinal Summary</h4>
<p>The Saints are commanded to "waste and wear out" their lives exposing hidden darkness. This hyperbolic expression conveys total consecration: time, energy, and even life itself are devoted to making truth known. Because heaven manifests these hidden things, the Saints bear responsibility to act. The work must be done with "great earnestness"—no half-hearted effort.</p>

<button class="sub-accordion" onclick="toggleSubSection(this)">Verses 15-17: Small Things, Cheerful Doing, and Standing Still</button>
<div class="sub-panel">
<div class="sub-panel-content">
<h4>Scripture Text</h4>
<strong><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/123.15?lang=eng">Doctrine & Covenants 123:15</a></strong> — "Let no man count them as small things; for there is much which lieth in futurity, pertaining to the saints, which depends upon these things."

<strong><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/123.16?lang=eng">Doctrine & Covenants 123:16</a></strong> — "You know, brethren, that a very large ship is benefited very much by a very small helm in the time of a storm, by being kept workways with the wind and the waves."

<strong><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/123.17?lang=eng">Doctrine & Covenants 123:17</a></strong> — "Therefore, dearly beloved brethren, let us cheerfully do all things that lie in our power; and then may we stand still, with the utmost assurance, to see the salvation of God, and for his arm to be revealed."

<h4>Doctrinal Summary</h4>
<p>Joseph warns against dismissing record-keeping as trivial. Future blessings hinge on present diligence. He employs a nautical metaphor: a massive ship survives storms by a small helm. Likewise, small acts—gathering affidavits, publishing truth—steer the Church through persecution.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em;">Verse 17 concludes with balanced discipleship: cheerful labor followed by faithful stillness. Saints do everything within their power, then wait with assurance for God's salvation. This encapsulates the covenant rhythm of exertion and trust.</p>
