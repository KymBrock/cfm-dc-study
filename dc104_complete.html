                <h2>Section Overview</h2>
                
                <h3>Basic Information</h3>
                <p><strong>Date of Revelation:</strong> April 23, 1834</p>
                <p><strong>Location:</strong> Kirtland, Ohio</p>
                <p><strong>Recipients:</strong> Joseph Smith and members of the United Order</p>
                <p><strong>Verses:</strong> 86 verses</p>
                <p><strong>Section Summary:</strong> The Lord reorganizes the United Order following covenant breaking by some members, establishes individual stewardships while maintaining collective consecration principles, and provides detailed instructions for managing Church properties and debts during a critical financial crisis.</p>
                
                <h3>Key Principles</h3>
                <p><strong>Primary Doctrinal Principle:</strong> True consecration operates through individual stewardships within a collective covenant, where each person is accountable to God for their portion while contributing to the common good.</p>
                <p><strong>Secondary Principle:</strong> Breaking covenants through covetousness brings severe spiritual consequences, including being delivered to the buffetings of Satan until redemption.</p>
                <p><strong>Application Principle:</strong> The Lord's way of caring for the poor requires the rich to be made low through consecration, creating equality and abundance for all.</p>
                
                <h3>Timeframe & Setting</h3>
                
                <h4>Circumstances Among Recipients</h4>
                <p>The United Order members faced a severe financial crisis. Some had broken their consecration covenants through covetousness and "feigned words" (v. 4). The order owed substantial debts, particularly for the temple lot and other properties. Members struggled between individual needs and collective obligations. Trust had been damaged by those who failed to live the law fully.</p>
                
                <h4>Circumstances Within the Church</h4>
                <p>The Church was preparing for Zion's Camp (D&C 103 given February 24, 1834). Temple construction in Kirtland required significant resources. The Missouri Saints had been driven from Jackson County and needed assistance. The original United Order structure proved unworkable due to human weakness and geographical separation between Ohio and Missouri.</p>
                
                <h4>Relevant Local Circumstances</h4>
                <p>Kirtland's economy was strained by the influx of Saints. Local merchants extended credit but expected payment. Anti-Mormon sentiment affected business dealings. The frontier economy operated largely on credit and promissory notes. Legal pressures mounted as creditors sought payment for Church debts.</p>
                
                <h4>Relevant Global Circumstances</h4>
                <p>Andrew Jackson's presidency saw economic volatility and the Bank War. The American frontier expansion created both opportunities and instabilities. Communitarian experiments like the Shakers provided alternative economic models. The concept of corporate ownership was still developing in American law.</p>
                
                <h3>Purpose of the Revelation</h3>
                
                <h4>Short Term</h4>
                <p>Dissolve the original United Order structure that had failed; assign specific stewardships to individual members; address immediate debt crisis threatening Church properties; separate Kirtland and Missouri operations; provide clear accountability for temporal resources.</p>
                
                <h4>Long Term</h4>
                <p>Establish eternal principles of consecration and stewardship; create a pattern for future economic cooperation; teach the relationship between temporal and spiritual salvation; prepare the Church for greater collective efforts; establish the law of tithing's foundation (later given in D&C 119).</p>
                
                <h3>Significance</h3>
                
                <h4>Short Term</h4>
                <p>The revelation saved Church properties from creditors. Members received individual stewardships providing personal responsibility. The separation of Kirtland and Missouri orders prevented total financial collapse. Specific assignments clarified roles and responsibilities. The debt management plan provided hope for financial freedom.</p>
                
                <h4>Long Term</h4>
                <p>This revelation established principles still governing Church welfare and finances. The concept of stewardship over consecration shapes modern Church programs. Individual accountability within collective goals remains central to Church organization. The promise of deliverance from debt through faithfulness continues to bless Saints. The pattern of temporal self-reliance supporting spiritual purposes endures.</p>
                
                <h3>Cultural Insights</h3>
                
                <h4>Ancient</h4>
                <p>The concept of Jubilee years and debt forgiveness echoes throughout (Leviticus 25). Individual stewardships mirror the tribal inheritances of Israel (Numbers 26:52-56). The treasury system parallels the temple treasury of ancient times (Mark 12:41-44). Covenant curses for unfaithfulness reflect Deuteronomic patterns (Deuteronomy 28). The principle of gleaning fields for the poor is expanded (Leviticus 19:9-10).</p>
                
                <h4>Modern</h4>
                <p>The revelation addresses modern economic challenges of debt and wealth inequality. Corporate structures and individual accountability within organizations reflect these principles. The welfare system of the Church implements these consecration principles. Modern stake and ward councils operate on similar organizational patterns. The principle of "enough and to spare" (v. 17) counters scarcity mindset.</p>
                
                <h3>Modern Application</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Personal Application:</strong> Recognize all possessions as stewardships from God; practice generous fast offerings and tithing; eliminate unnecessary debt; share abundance with those in need</li>
                    <li><strong>Family Application:</strong> Teach children about stewardship vs. ownership; implement family councils for financial decisions; practice consecration through family service; establish family emergency funds</li>
                    <li><strong>Church Application:</strong> Support ward welfare efforts; magnify callings as stewardships; contribute to temple building; participate in self-reliance programs</li>
                    <li><strong>Community Application:</strong> Ethical business practices reflecting consecration; community service using professional skills; economic justice advocacy; sustainable resource management</li>
                    <li><strong>Questions for Personal Study:</strong> How can I better recognize my stewardships? What would true consecration look like in my life? How do I balance individual needs with collective good? What debts (spiritual or temporal) need addressing? How can I prepare for future consecration requirements?</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The Financial Crisis of 1834</h3>
                
                <h4>Immediate Debts</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temple Lot:</strong> $2,000 owed for Kirtland Temple land</li>
                    <li><strong>Printing Office:</strong> Debts for press and supplies</li>
                    <li><strong>Personal Debts:</strong> Leaders had pledged personal credit</li>
                    <li><strong>Missouri Aid:</strong> Supporting expelled Saints required funds</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Failed Business Ventures</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Tannery:</strong> Sidney Rigdon's operation struggled</li>
                    <li><strong>Store:</strong> N.K. Whitney's mercantile faced credit issues</li>
                    <li><strong>Farm Operations:</strong> Poor yields and market prices</li>
                    <li><strong>United Order Store:</strong> Competition with non-member merchants</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Why the Original Order Failed</h3>
                
                <h4>Human Weaknesses</h4>
                <p>Covetousness among some members created discord. Unequal sacrifice perception led to resentment. Geographic separation between Ohio and Missouri made coordination difficult. Lack of business experience hindered operations. External persecution pressure stressed the system.</p>
                
                <h4>Structural Issues</h4>
                <p>No clear individual accountability existed in the original structure. Unclear property rights created confusion. Mixed spiritual and temporal authority complicated decisions. Insufficient capital base limited operations. Legal vulnerability exposed the order to external threats.</p>
                
                <h3>The Reorganization Solution</h3>
                
                <h4>Individual Stewardships</h4>
                <p>Clear property assignments gave each member specific responsibility. Personal accountability was established through individual stewardships. Inheritance rights were defined for posterity. Business name separation protected assets legally.</p>
                
                <h4>Maintained Unity</h4>
                <p>Common treasury for publishing preserved collective efforts. Committee governance provided checks and balances. Mutual support obligations continued among members. Shared spiritual purposes unified the separated orders.</p>
                
                <h3>Key People and Their Assignments</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sidney Rigdon:</strong> Received the tannery lot for his stewardship</li>
                    <li><strong>Martin Harris:</strong> Assigned land to devote money for proclaiming the word</li>
                    <li><strong>Frederick G. Williams:</strong> Kept his residence and shared printing office</li>
                    <li><strong>Oliver Cowdery:</strong> Received printing office lot with Williams</li>
                    <li><strong>John Johnson:</strong> Kept his house and managed lot sales</li>
                    <li><strong>Newel K. Whitney:</strong> Appointed over mercantile establishment as treasurer</li>
                    <li><strong>Joseph Smith Jr.:</strong> Received temple lot and inheritance for father's support</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Long-Term Impact</h3>
                
                <h4>Immediate Results</h4>
                <p>Properties were saved from creditors through the reorganization. Publishing of revelations continued uninterrupted. Members had clear roles and responsibilities. Missouri and Ohio operations were successfully separated.</p>
                
                <h4>Future Patterns Established</h4>
                <p>The pattern of bishops' storehouses emerged from these principles. Ward welfare systems follow the consecration model. The Church welfare program implements these concepts globally. Humanitarian efforts reflect the abundance principle. The Perpetual Education Fund embodies stewardship accountability.</p>

                    <div class="scripture-quote">
                        <p><strong>1</strong> Verily I say unto you, my friends, I give unto you counsel, and a commandment, concerning all the properties which belong to the order which I commanded to be organized and established, to be a united order, and an everlasting order for the benefit of my church, and for the salvation of men until I come—</p>
                        <p><strong>2</strong> With promise immutable and unchangeable, that inasmuch as those whom I commanded were faithful they should be blessed with a multiplicity of blessings;</p>
                        <p><strong>3</strong> But inasmuch as they were not faithful they were nigh unto cursing.</p>
                        <p><strong>4</strong> Therefore, inasmuch as some of my servants have not kept the commandment, but have broken the covenant through covetousness, and with feigned words, I have cursed them with a very sore and grievous curse.</p>
                        <p><strong>5</strong> For I, the Lord, have decreed in my heart, that inasmuch as any man belonging to the order shall be found a transgressor, or, in other words, shall break the covenant with which ye are bound, he shall be cursed in his life, and shall be trodden down by whom I will;</p>
                        <p><strong>6</strong> For I, the Lord, am not to be mocked in these things—</p>
                        <p><strong>7</strong> And all this that the innocent among you may not be condemned with the unjust; and that the guilty among you may not escape; because I, the Lord, have promised unto you a crown of glory at my right hand.</p>
                        <p><strong>8</strong> Therefore, inasmuch as you are found transgressors, you cannot escape my wrath in your lives.</p>
                        <p><strong>9</strong> Inasmuch as ye are cut off for transgression, ye cannot escape the buffetings of Satan until the day of redemption.</p>
                        <p><strong>10</strong> And I now give unto you power from this very hour, that if any man among you, of the order, is found a transgressor and repenteth not of the evil, that ye shall deliver him over unto the buffetings of Satan; and he shall not have power to bring evil upon you.</p>

                        <p><strong>12</strong> That every man may give an account unto me of the stewardship which is appointed unto him.</p>
                        <p><strong>13</strong> For it is expedient that I, the Lord, should make every man accountable, as a steward over earthly blessings, which I have made and prepared for my creatures.</p>
                        <p><strong>14</strong> I, the Lord, stretched out the heavens, and built the earth, my very handiwork; and all things therein are mine.</p>

                        <p><strong>16</strong> But it must needs be done in mine own way; and behold this is the way that I, the Lord, have decreed to provide for my saints, that the poor shall be exalted, in that the rich are made low.</p>
                        <p><strong>17</strong> For the earth is full, and there is enough and to spare; yea, I prepared all things, and have given unto the children of men to be agents unto themselves.</p>

                    <h4>Etymology & Historical Usage</h4>
                    <p>From Old English <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/steward" target="_blank">*stiweard*</a>, literally "house guardian," from stig "hall, pen" + weard "guard"</p>
                    <p><strong>Webster 1828:</strong> <a href="https://webstersdictionary1828.com/Dictionary/stewardship" target="_blank">Stewardship</a> — "The office of a steward; the management of domestic concerns"</p>
                    
                    <h4>Doctrinal Significance</h4>
                    <p>In D&C 104, stewardship transforms from mere management to sacred accountability. Each person receives specific properties not as ownership but as divine trust, accountable to God for their use.</p>

                    <h4>Doctrinal Significance</h4>
                    <p>The United Order represents the temporal implementation of celestial law—unity in purpose while maintaining individual stewardships. It's not communism but consecration, requiring both collective commitment and personal accountability.</p>

                    <h4>Doctrinal Significance</h4>
                    <p>In D&C 104, covenant breaking through "covetousness and feigned words" brings cursing. Sacred covenants with God involve both temporal and spiritual obligations, with severe consequences for violation.</p>

                    <h4>Doctrinal Significance</h4>
                    <p>Transgression specifically refers to covenant breaking through covetousness. It results in being "cursed in life" and "trodden down," with ultimate delivery to Satan's buffetings.</p>

                        <li><strong>Plenty:</strong> <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7647/kjv/wlc/0-1/" target="_blank">שָׂבָע (*saba*)</a> — "plenty, satiety, abundance"</li>

                    <h4>Doctrinal Significance</h4>
                    <p>"The earth is full, and there is enough and to spare" (v. 17) contradicts worldly scarcity mindset. Abundance exists when shared according to God's law.</p>

                <h3>7. Buffetings of Satan</h3>
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>Hebrew Foundation</h4>
                    <ul>

                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Buffet:</strong> <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2852/kjv/tr/0-1/" target="_blank">κολαφίζω (*kolaphizo*)</a> — "to strike with fist, buffet, maltreat"</li>

                    <h4>Doctrinal Significance</h4>
                    <p>Being delivered to Satan's buffetings represents withdrawal of divine protection, allowing the adversary to afflict the transgressor. This continues "until the day of redemption," suggesting a long but not eternal duration.</p>
